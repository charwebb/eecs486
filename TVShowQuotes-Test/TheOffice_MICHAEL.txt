Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.
Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I don't think I ate for three days. [Michael passes out]
[passes Isabel] Hey, good morning.  [to Dwight] It's about damn time.  I haven't gone to the bathroom in a day and a half.  [walks into hotel room]  Oh my God, Dwight.  This room is a pit.
No, no, no, no, no.  You know what?  You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.
Are you... are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? 'Cause you're grossing me out.
Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine.
Goin'. Ok.  Where we goin'?  Doesn't matter.  Goin' to the go go. [nervous laugh] Oh-ok.
And the sequel, 'Woman Stands at Desk and Works.' So, I have no idea how you, [he sits on the floor] how you sit like that.
Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?
What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point.
All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan. [Ryan holds up his bag] Very good. Excellent, excellent.
Hey. Where's my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I don't know where she is. 'Cause I'm drunk, I can't even find her.
The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.
Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what's best for you, Mo Chuisle.
No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. Kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'.
We'll go.  I'm still recovering. So let's just, Ryan, could you get my coat please.
[accent] Whoa. What's this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son?  This here's Savannah.
Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok?  I'm in the best shape of my life.  Look at this. [flexes his arms] Brrr!  That's strong!
Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads...
It's complicated with Jan.  And I don't know where I stand, or what I want.  The sex isn't nearly as good as it used to be.
Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould. [walking out of his office] Jan, hello.  I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah.
[in the background] Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Let's just clap.
Oh, Oh, I take umbrage to that premise...ses. Umm, let me ask you this: How many people exist in the world? Over forty billion. What are they going to be writing on... rocks? Any one else? [points] Yep.
[to Dwight] Shut, it. Can I... can I just do it please? [to Ryan] Uh, it's equal.
Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.
[standing in front of his office, sees that it is three forty five] Okay, everybody come on. Conference room five seconds! Let's go! Hurry up, let's do this! [Dwight runs into the conference room. All others follow]
Movie Monday!  The only cure I know for the Monday blues is... Varsity Blues!
Uh, that's what she said.  See, haven't lost my sense of humor.  No, no need, it was a non-stick grill.
No, I'm kidding.  No, you're not--you're not fired.  Yet.
Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You're like our little man...
There's no time to think about if this is real.  Just, shh, everybody. [knock at the front door]
Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex.
How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator.
No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.
Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. [everyone raises their hand]
Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.
Sabre is changing everything. [Michael and David sitting in hot tub] Site blockers. They don't let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David Wallace would know what to do. What should I do, David Wallace?
Well they notice it.  Don't you?  You notice it.  It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it?
[holding up a Dundie and pretending it is talking] Hello. I'm Michael Scott. I'm the best boss in the world.
Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great!
[whispering to Pam] They have him surrounded. It's the SWAT. The SWAT's arriving.
Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef. [points to chef] Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak. [leans over to neighboring man's plate] I see steak.
Well the invitation says VIP's only.  Is this how you treat your VIP's, Ryan?  We're already in the city.  The main part with the buildings.  What am I supposed to do?  What do you want me to do tonight?  And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up!  Okay I'm going to throw up.  I'm throwing up.  You're making me throw up, Ryan.
These people need love and I am going to get it for them  Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today?  A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.  I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say 'I'm in love I was hit by cupid's sparrow.'  Funny little bird, but he gets the job done.
Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, 200, 300 people before. Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing?
Well, I don't know what it's gonna be called, but... my point is, the future of this company is now.  And the future... is me.
I think I'm going to make myself some microwave popcorn. [humming] Press 'Popcorn.' Oh, that's gonna be delicious. I just love having popcorn in the middle of the afternoon. You know what? I could do with some hot chocolate as well. Oh, drat. I can't make hot chocolate and popcorn at the same time, unless, I can. Boom! Second microwave for le hot chocolat.
What the hell was that? [Michael starts to fight with Dwight]
Did somebody say 'baby back ribs'?  Hmmm? Hmmmmm?
[no longer talking to Dwight as Wallace] Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that.
Did you ever think of this?  Would a sober person walk in front of a car?
Did you see Born on the Fourth of July?  I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy.
Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it.
I'm about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent. They'll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay. [dials phone]
Thank you very much. You didn't have to say that.
Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.
I did, because I am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers.
Let's go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf. Let us go.
Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.
This is weird. I can't believe you're here. This feels like you never left. Doesn't it?
There are ten rules of business that you need to learn.  Number one: You need to play to win. But... you also have to win to play.
Yeeee... Guys! Do you consider Gabe to be the boss?
Yeah, okay.  Call the school, cancel.  I can't go through with this.
Don't talk to me that way please. Just... they're going to want to hear this from you.
O-kay. Oh... hey, hey. [follows Oscar into the hall] What are you doing?
No, no. I just needed to hear your voice.
I have it on good authority that you said the following. [hands Andy a notecard]  Can you read that back to me?
No no no.  The only signal that I am sending is:
Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.
Well, it says here that it's a 300ft drop.
Well Stanley, maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well.
I left a copy of Best American Mystery Stories 1999 in Toby's favorite stall. So, yes, I think I bought us some time.
No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas.
Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero.
You're thinking of the broad jump.  Would you try-- bungee jumping?
Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site.
Oh, hey, hey, no, don't run. You're gonna slip.
Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior.
There are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work. [spinning in chair] He is a fan of the outrageous. He loves to surprise! He loves... other things as well.
[sighs] No, Dwight.  I am worried.  A man's life is in my hands.
OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit?
No, no, no, no.  I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine's, and I think that there are other single people out there too.  We just need to find them.  There's a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park.  There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.
No, it is a perfect smell-alike. I'm not paying for the label. Right here. Give it.
Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months.
[after talking to David, Jim looks dejected] I can't help but feel partially responsible.
I was probably going to break up with her anyway.
Well, it has always been a lifelong dream.
[singing] You... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by... [Dwight joins in] and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well...
Right. See? I don't even know, first-name basis!
I know what you want to ask me. 'Did your mom ever see you naked?'
[getting off his stomach] Too personal. I don't wanna hear about it. [picking up a portable tape player] Let's try this. Put these on. [DeAngelo puts the headphones in] I am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up. So you can't- [DeAngelo winces] That's right, you're not going to be able to hear yourself. Read this, [gives him a card] and make it sound perfect.
Would have been nice to work with my family. It would have been nice if Luke had been able to stay here. But he couldn't. These things seldom work out. I don't know how Ringling Brothers do it. Night after night, town after town, all across America. You would think they'd be sick of each other by now. But, clearly, they make it work. And my hat's off to them.
I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.
No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said?
Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.
Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring.
Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.
Yes, um, Jim.  Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.
I think an investor's ski trip is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience.
I. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay.
That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.
Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you?
Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all.
[on speakerphone in Dwight's car] Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn.
No, I have plenty of friends, so... all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary. [Flips a pancake. It's about 8x11 inches] Young sir, would you like a free pancake?
Can you believe it? Well, we'll see, we'll see. It's just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so
All right. Mmhmm. [both start laughing and hug] Hey.
[to Jim] No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man.
Question. How long do we have to... [Telephone rings] Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?
Actually, I'm a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a... celestine prophesy, and keep the next Bon Jovi from ever picking up a piano.
And business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best.  Actually better than a five-star hotel 'cause you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine.  I think I am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce.
Eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it.
[in the office, imitating the terminator] I'll be baaaaack!  And I am baaaack!
No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.
Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.
Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to, [Ryan stands up] Danny Cordray! [Ryan quickly sits] Danny couldn't be here tonight...
The party I'm having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited.
Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he's kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think.
Presents. I got presents for everybody. Dwight, a genuine Rastafarian wig.
Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter?
[eating the watermelon] It is going to be the happiest day of my life. [Dwight gets dressed behind Michael and zips his fly]
All right everybody. I'm out of here. Jim, you're in charge.
That's it, that's it, perfect.  We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.
[having walked up to the front] Okay, driver, driver, if you're not gonna stop this bus, then I'm going to stop it for you. Okay? Hang on. [pulls the string to request a stop, makes a dinging sound]
Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party?
Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here.  Everybody I'd like to introduce you to Elizabeth.
I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio?
Ok, let's do this thing.  [to Pam] Wish us luck.
I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important...
[to the camera] This had better be terrible.
You know what, Christmas isn't about Santa, or Jesus. It's about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, you're my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas.  And Stanley, you're our mailman. And I can't help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, 'How could they do this to us?'
OK, I'll take it. [misses free throw] OK.
So, what about you, Angela?  Do you have any single friends?
We're doing this because of you.  So why don't you just go stand somewhere else.  [to Ryan] Hey.  Hey.  You shaved?
[runs by] Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit.
I will do my job to the best of my abilities.
NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!
Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it? [looks at watch] Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.
[deep sigh] There could be others...  I need to know.  I don't want to offend anybody else.
Oh, Holly doesn't need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her.
[shifting uncomfortably and sweating] Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.
I think better to be a happy idiot then a, um... Then someone who knows the truth.
Don't go. I don't want you to go. Oh don't go. Don't go.
Works in accounting.  This is uh, concierge Marie...
[Jim has the ball] Jim! Jim! Right here! [runs into the elbow of the guy guarding him] Ow! God! Hold it!
And the same thing goes for quarterly reports.  They are unreadable.  They're just numbers and boring and blech.  So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar? [everyone groans] Doesn't have to be a racecar.  Use your imagination.
You can't pass. You've got to pick somebody.
That wasn't even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don't get mad at me.
Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I've ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head.
Hey, hey, hey stop it.  Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no.  I kidnapped a kid.
Okay. [to man entering office] Hello. [introduces] Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.
I thought that you might say that. [takes off his shoe; hums; takes out cash from shoe]
Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.
I will handle it in the best way possible, but in case he or she goes postal, you will be available to subdue. Am I correct?
[singing] Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. [hits repeat again]
[Andy is playing with the tire iron] Take that thing off the table! Please!
I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over.
I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I don't think you need to worry. Because if you want to beat China you will. If you don't, that's fine. That my friend, is your victory. Y'know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China, and that may be the true, but what they don't tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation.
This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I'm right on the other side of this wall. [knocks on wall]  used to be a window here. There's not anymore. So, that's where I will be.
Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad. [hugs Ryan]
...you just gots to get your freak on.
Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.
This next award goes to somebody, who really, lights up the office.
By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier.'
Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.
Okay, this is the moment that you have all been waiting for. Our first item up for bids tonight is something that I consider to be very boss indeed. [cheers and applause] It is a Yoga lesson from Holly Flax! Yoga! And I would like to start the bidding off at 300 dollars. [auctioneer voice] 300 dollars do I hear 300 dollars? 300 dollars. Hey, batter batter batter, hey batter, swing batter, 300 dollars, 300 dollars, 300 dollars. Anybody, 300 dollars. 400 dollars. Who wants for 400-[speaking gibberish] Do I see somebody in the back? Is there somebody in the back? Do I see somebody in the back? 400-450 [speaking gibberish] Sold! For 300 dollars to me! [bangs gavel, which squeaks] What the hell is that?
Oh, you know what?  You know what?  I shouldn't go in there.  I'm pretty busy, I should just...
It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby.
Pam, I don't make the rules. [Pam walks out.]
I don't like lump. I'm really upset about this.
Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life.  She treated me poorly.  We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.  Love is a mystery.
No!  That is the fun of this place.  I call everybody 'faggie'. Why would anybody find that offensive?
Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch 'Lazy Scranton'.
Do you? I don't think you do. Devon was one of my best buddies. And now he hates me.
Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?
I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you?
Ready to play some games? Let's do it!
I just got off the horn with David Wallace, and he said that you and I should try to get to know each other better. And I agree, so what I would like you to do is tell me something that you've never told anybody before.
No, I'm not calling your weirdo cousin.  Twenty-seven years old, never left the beet farm.
It's not a birthday, it's not a good-bye party...
[to Erin] Shave me. [walks into office with Deangelo] This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!
No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?
Utica is snoozeville, um, Albany are the prepsters, Nashua, no parking, um, Akron is haunted, Camden... is in a basement, Yonkers has the two hot girls, and here in Scranton, we are the cool guys.
[Ryan grabs some shoes] Look what he's doing.
Just words. Inspiring words. [under breath] Not a contender. [out loud] For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.
So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.
It's nice to meet you, too. It's an honor and a privilege.
Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me.
Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.
Oh, oh, oh!  We'll get somebody to clean that up.
Wait a second. [removes condom from wallet, throws it to Jim] I don't want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.
Yeah, happy times.  Come on.  Let's have happy times.
I'm tying a knot in the stem with my tongue.
But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.
Pictures. Memories. [Picks up a framed photo of Stanley's daughter from Stanley's desk] Look at that. They grow up so fast.
Hello, hello.  Hey!  Your face is almost back to normal.
[running out of the building with Oscar, Andy, and Dwight] Oscar! Oscar! Come on!  There he is! There he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!  Scranton! Scranton! Scranton! Dunder Mifflin!
You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna go in there and tell her that we can't be together.
Number eight, learn how to take off a woman's bra.
Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.
I don't ask for much for Christmas, I really don't. It's not like I'm begging people to buy me diamonds and ...broach pendants. 'Oh buy me something expensive or I'm gonna kill myself.'  That's not - I don't care about that. All I want to be is Santa. And, you want to take that away from me?  Fine. Go ahead. But when you need my help because I am ruining everything, don't look at me.
Look at that! He threw 'em on the ground!
[on the roof] My life!  Oh, my life...
The big, free mirrors that the city puts up, on trees and telephone poles?  The big round things.
No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.
We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white? [screen saver box hits the wall]
[whispers] The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame.
Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do.
No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK. [sniffing] You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan? [sighs]
[while in his reeking office]  I am a big Fear Factor fan.  I'm a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape.  Um... [clearing throat]   I can't stand it [gets up to leave], I can't stay in here another second.  No!
I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.
She is pregnant. She is knocked up. 'K' Karen. Pam, let's go.
Oh, my gosh, well... Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale. That's what I say, so...
How can you give up my diary like that?
Interesting.  Jan is calling me.  Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all. [puts Jan on speakerphone] Yeah?
Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she's hot!  And you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses. And that you were the blind one. He's the most... important thing in my life right now.
Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.
Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.
Why don't we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up?
I watch the L Word.  I watch, Queer as F***, so...
Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, Kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.
I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing? [silence] It bothers me that you're not answering the question.
[slightly drunk] What am I gonna do? I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. I gonna do a little bit of this, a little bit of that.  I gonna stay up all day.  Gonna sleep it up all night. I'm gonna give it a OHH! HEY! HO!  And I'm going to stop worrying about calories.
I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.
Yeah! My last physical when I was forty.
Ryan, I want to see you with a hot dog in your mouth. Right now.
Good question.  Forrest Gump: mentally challenged, Philadelphia [points to a picture from Big]: AIDS.
No no no no no no no. [accent] I'm going to skip forward to a relevant clue.  Here we go.
You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish.
Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
Where?  I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer.  Come on, let's go.
Well then it's a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him!
Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this?
What you don't know... Well, it can hurt you, but if you don't know it won't hurt you. Then, you can just be happy for a little while at least.
Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here's an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen. [sighs] Ahh!
It's 4:30 in the morning.  Do you know where your kids are?  If you are Ryan's parents or Pam's parents or my parents, you do.  They're gonna be in this van.  With me.  Who am I?  Nothing to fear.  I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route.
Those are just things.  This is how I want it to feel.
Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet.
[ignores Phyllis)] Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.
This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything.
Bop bop de Bope bop bop bop bop bop. You only have me for a limited time... Yes.
Okay, well, we had scheduled this time to watch a movie together, so I guess I will just go play some online Scrabble.
Actually I think it's not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah! [takes remote, raises volume] There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord!
Yeah. You know what? I am. I'm gonna call her. That's a good idea.
Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?
[Burp] Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I'm getting a stitch. [groans]
Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him: 'Hey! Hey Scott!'
Oh ho, oh, he's running. He's running. He's running, but he can't hide because you know what? One o'clock, you better bring your 'A' game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!
Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha.
Okay, well, we'll figure something. [Michael turns and starts back toward his office]
[banging on the glass] Hey, hey.  What are you doing?  Don't talk to them.
When you use something to block-- I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It's not necessarily different for the woman--
And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?
What is Jim telling him?  That I can't handle this job?  That 's bull crap.  That is bull crap.  Although, it has been chaotic lately.  Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients.  I will tell you there has been work everyday.  Had to come in on a Saturday. To retrieve... I left my cell phone here.
Toby actually gets alimony from his ex-wife because she makes more, so that's kind of embarrassing. Not that I'd mind, but it would never happen to me because I would make the marriage work. People seem to like him because they think he's one of us, but he's not. He's this weird loner who just tells people, 'Don't do this, don't do that. Hire this person for this reason.' I would complain about him, but who would I go to, to complain about Toby? Toby. Bias. And what does he do about that? Nothing. Because he's Toby. What kind of name is that? It's almost a girl's name. I think I've known more girls named Toby than guys. He just kind of makes my skin crawl a little bit. Toby is the devil. Toby's the devil.
There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down.
Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?
Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?
Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we're going to take your clothes off.
That's-- no, no-- it's not about numbers, Pam.  It's about attitude.
How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people.
Do you think I'll get any new ones?  I could... [pause, eventually looks up at Dwight]
Okay. Like he's going to win anyway, right? [laughs]
Oh, I see, you're chickening out on me. You're bailing on me.
Well, now I can say that I went to a museum.
[speaks in a Yoda voice] Much advice you seek. [regular voice] Do you know who that is?
It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard!
Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them.  Especially that one. [Points to Phyllis]
Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.
I used to get offers in the mail for credit cards all the time.  They would say things like 'don't pay for six months' or 'you can transfer your account from another card'...
And you know what else we're gonna do? I can't believe I'm gonna say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost. I know. I could get in a lotta trouble for this, so you'd better shake my hand right now.
Well, what should I do, guys? Seriously, do you want me to just cancel the Dundies?
No.  No more.  The tests are going terrible.  If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump.  This is about doing, not thinking.
Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there. [clears throat] Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isn't tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight. [clears throat again] So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought [choking up, clears throat again] sorry. [laughs nervously] I think I have a frog in my throat. Um... [sigh] I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um... [Michael walks off stage, knocking over the snare drum]
Hello. Hi. [to Pam] Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me.
Well, I'm gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it's best to wait till the end of the day.
I say, I say, I say, I say down Holly! I'll take it from here. I am beautiful. [hangs pictures of fat people on the wall, including two fat people on a bike, the Ghostbusters Marshmallow Man, Elvis, Martin Lawrence in Big Mamma's House, Jabba the Hutt, and a fat pig] They are beautiful. He is beautiful.  This big fat pig is beautiful.
What?  Part of your duties are to what?
I, I surely do, and don't call me honey. [Jo laughs] You were playing too.
Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. [Donna laughing] Just kidding. Do you like mints?
Uh, you know what?  I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.
[tea bags on eyes] Do I feel badly, that nobody out there was invited to a party that I was invited to?  Not at all.  Because they have to know that if they work hard and apply themselves, someday, they could be invited to a party like this.  Of course, at that point, I will be going to much better parties that they will not be able to get into.  What are you gonna do?
That's the problem, that's the problem.  We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll.  Alright? [sees Toby in a bow-tie holding a plate full of tea cups] Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving.  I- I have no words.
Oh, no problem. [looks down] And he signed!  He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately.
No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers.
We get right in the car, we pop up to Montreal. It's like another seven hours.
Do you want me to go on Amazon and order you a slang dictionary? Cause I'll do it.
Okay, let me tell you a little story. When I was on vacation, I met a man named Bavon. And Bavon takes people parasailing. And you know what he said to me? He said that he loves going to work every day. How many of you can say that you love going to work every day like Bavon? [Dwight and Andy raises hand] No one.
These people just don't realize what a gift basket means, they don't get it.
Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.
Could I talk to you for a second?
Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!
[putting his shoes back on, talking to the camera crew] Well, I guess this is it. Hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. Alright... Oh! [pulls out his mic from his shirt] This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest. [he hands them the body mic, when he speaks it is inaudible now] That's what she said! [waves goodbye and walks off to his gate, halfway there Pam comes running up to him and they hug for a while. They say their goodbyes to each other, and Michael walks off for good]
Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.
I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone.
Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me.
Ryan is a temp, and that means that he could go at any time. Am I worried about that? Try scared to death.
Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.
That would be hot. I would pay to see that.
Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?  It's... pssssh... .  He was almost 70.  Circle of life.
Do you mean it? You want to have a kid? [Jan walks away]
Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn't be apologizing to Packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.
Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye... bye.
I am jetting off on an international business trip.
[as Mikanos] Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on.
I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.
Just close your eyes. I'm going to start my own paper company.
Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.
Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?
Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.
[unlocks door] Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!
That's what she... a lot of places are like that.
Uh huh, uh huh. [under his breath] Power trip.
Would you like to help me with a special project?
I'm just saying that I think I agree with your point.
[in front of poster] Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using 'I' emotion language and no judging or 'you' statements.
If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar.  That's how it works.  They inherit things through the breast milk.
[accent] Sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect.
I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst.
It's up to you to change his mind.
That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy. [Andy looks confused and shrugs] Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-
That is. [Jim sees them and looks happy] It's gonna be awesome. I think you're really going to enjoy it down there.
What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?
You know it's really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price.
All right, listen up, please. Dwight has a joke.
[pulls out a recorder and speaks softly into it] T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert. [starts to cry] You started with this company, as a fine young man...
God, you look like such an idiot. [both yelling] [grunting]
This is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive. [to Toby] Right? Would you agree with that?
Hey Hey, I don't go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!
No, no, no it's not against the rules.  She's not a permanent employee so it's not.
Uh, I'm not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So... you're the moron.
I can't Andy, it's too hard. That's-I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that?
Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place.  The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap. [finds radon kit in between his blinds in his office] But I figured I'd rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc. [throws it away] The second time... I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos. [finds another radon kit on top of his cabinet] Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite. [takes radon kit from the top of the blinds of his office window and slams it into the trash can]
Okay. I'll see you tonight. I love you.
Ok, I am going to count down from five.
Look, I am not a gazillionaire.  I can't... I can't dress like Donald Trump dresses.  I have to stay within the parameters of my budget.  I can't shop at a fancy Norwegian boutique.  I buy my suits the old fashioned way.  I buy them from discount stores... or on eBay.  And when I found out that Ross was having a midnight madness sale, I ran, not walked, as per the instructions on the flier.  And I got there, and when the doors opened, all of these women ran to this one bin.  And I did too.  And I grabbed this suit.  And a woman, sort of a, I don't know, Missy Elliot type, grabbed the jacket.  And, uh, we had kind of a heated tug of war.  And I could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get.  And I figured she was just buying it for her husband, to answer your question from before.  Um, anyway, she s... socked me, in the eye.  And she got it, she got the suit.  But, I went to the Ross, in Trenton New Jersey, and I found the exact same suit.  And I didn't have to deal with Missy Elliot.
So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it?
You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.
Okay, you get out of here, big dog. [high-fives Stanley] Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.
Let's go. [starts walking towards the elevator] I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her.
I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?
It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could... And she is going to be OK.
I can give you more money-there's your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-there's your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?
Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N.
Sure thing. [both go out of conference room] 'Scuse me. [closes door]
Let me see your teeth.  Let me see 'em.  Let me see 'em.
I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.
No! Okay. [runs out the door] All right.
Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick.  What are you doin' for lunch?
When I needed salespeople for my new paper company,  everyone here turned their back on me.  Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness?  No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No.  Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No.  I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.
Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don't worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha...  [bumps into something] ... ha ha ha.
You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car. [sighs] And it's not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesn't make any sense... God is dead.
I don't even know how to say this, but Cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. And that's not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out.
Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.
Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan?
No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say?
Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.
All right.  [all stand up to leave] And she won't say, 'I love you.'
Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it.
I totally agree with you.  But I don't have money problems, I don't.  Alright, you know what?  Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this? [Michael holds up a bill, crumples it up, puts it back in his pocket]
Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind?
I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
[Kelly eating in the break room] Hey, is that healthy food?
Can I have everyone's attention please?  Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who's supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question?  Do you all know what it's like to be disabled?  Oscar?
[to Kevin] Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up?
All right, switch. Take it up a notch, come on.
What's going on? What's going on? You're playing like a bunch of girls.
Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can.
Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now.
Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.
No! That is a toboggan, you never know when you're gonna find a snowy hill so... Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie.
No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?
I know what we're going to do. We're going to put our best minds on it.
Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot.  I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.
Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.
Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.
You know, I don't care what he did to me.  He's mean to other people, that's what gets me.  He's just...
Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.
Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
[kicking through rubbish at the dump] You've changed, man.
[whispers to father] That's ok. [Albert gets out of his wheelchair and starts walking]
What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, 'Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?' Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.
Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. [bump fists]
it was fun. We had a good time.
[on microphone] Oh, that's appropriate. Lot of fire where you're going. Better get used to it. You're going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. You're going to Hell Stanley.
Oh man.  It's not a Jodie Foster afternoon without Little Man Tate, buddy.
OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. [Pam nods] Let's go!
[Pam storms into break room] Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom?  Is that how we're gonna get past this?  Cause, I will.
Well we did talk about how handsome you are.
Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party.
Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself?
What is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for? [Julie laughs]
Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.
If you don't let me pursue my artistic vision, I am going to walk!
You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please [makes drum roll noises], the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!
Dwight. Dwight. Dwight! Okay, that's it. Keep it in your pants.
Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.
Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think.
Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we're into isn't very condo-appropriate.
Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck.  'Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete.  I think it's because they respect me.  A boss that will not fire you, even though you just tell him off... right to his face... over the hone.  That's respect.
Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go! [contestants start walking]
Pam, come on. 'I like your food.' Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real.
[to Martin] How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.
Ohhh, great.  Well, now I'm in a terrible mood.  Let's do your performance review-
Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership.
Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?! [employees protest] All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that's just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebody's bitch. Oh, and you. [points to Ryan] You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don't drop the soap! Don't drop the soap!
Don't mind if I do.  See you in a minute.  [goes back down pretend stairs and grabs pen from Stanley's desk]
Here we go. This is gonna be good.
Okay, let's get personal for a second, shall we?
A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.
Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?
Ok guys, you know what?  I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation.
That guy's got more than he can handle as it is.
Here's what I was thinking. The following weekend, I drive up.
Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim?
[to David] This is not as much fun as I thought it would be.
[laughs hysterically] Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.
Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.
Thank you! [Pam hands him blank paper] What, what is this?
So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?
Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just...
But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model.
Hey Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse?
No it is- don't! I'm not gonna bump. I'm not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying. [Stanley laughs]
Here's the thing.  When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference.  Alert the media, and then you control the story.  Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you.  That's what happened to O.J.
Okay, okay... here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.
No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet.
Really? You seriously said that? Okay. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone?
[points to bathroom door] So is this the meeting you've been in all day?
Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so... I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?
Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids?
Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If you're here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left. [Creed looks around] So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best shot. I am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may. [Angela jumps up] Ok... lower the mic for the midget.
[flashback to Stanley's birthday] Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug.
Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I don't know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a
Here we go, alright got it? Set? [the door is ajar, Michael knocks lightly] Hello? [turns around to see Meredith walking towards her house]
Being the boss is also about image.  I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. 'Outside Hire.'
I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's gangbang this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.
Open your mouth.  Come on. Don't swallow it.
I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all.
I became a salesman... because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but... You know? I'm very successful... your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think?
No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go. [Michael spits out key, Jim covers it with his foot.]
That is a very firm handshake.  Ow, ow, aahch!  Killing my hand, there.
This is going out to Indians everywhere. It's a tribute to one of the greats... Mr. Adam Sandler. [sings] Diwali is a festival of lights. Let me tell you something. Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, it's time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But it's not Christmas, it's Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Don't invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali. If you're Indian and you love to party, have a  happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali. Happy Diwali!
Jan and I had an off again, on again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case, and I am sorry, but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition.
That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to...
Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches! [sits on couch]
Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?
Do you remember what color my eyes are?
[slams palms on desk] Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you.
Well your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy the coach won't play him frankly.
Not last - no. In like the last ten years.
All right, OK. [to Andy] Sorry.  Sorry.  Here we go.  Here we go!
Oh, no, no, no.  You're good.  It was clerical.  You're good.  Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.
Pull it together, all right? Stop lookin' at him.
Well, if you hadn't stopped the scene, you would have seen where it was going.
Well, I just like to look good OK, so ---
No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.
Well, [clears throat] I've actually done a lot of thinking about that.  And in ten years, I am living in a big house, with my kids.  And in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and I have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth.  And, because it's the future, I can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day.
We can talk about that. [Dwight high fives Michael] All right.
Hey, hey, hey. Something about that seems inappropriate.
Was its heart beating, Toby?  Did you check it?  No, of course you didn't.  You're not a veterinarian.  You don't know ANYTHING! [runs out of conference room crying]
Oh, come on.  We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul.
Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison. [Dwight starts to run] No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!
Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?
It's just that you never got married and you live in an apartment.
Just one joke.  Ok.  Well, if it's just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke.  Umm... let's see... choo choo choo.
We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.
That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.
Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza.  Please, thank you.
That mush have been a surprise when... at the gas station you proposed.
One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today.
Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.
I want somebody to give me the name of one of our biggest competitors.
Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.
It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--
No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working.  What are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops?
You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money, she thinks I'm a human ATM machine.
Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.
Well, he's just thinking about his own gifts.
If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster.  See you guys tomorrow.
And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.
Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?
Hey, Stanley. I don't tell you how to do your job, do I? He...
No, David. You listen to me.  Why did you send her away? That--- God.  You knew I liked her and you just sent her away.  And that--- that was a sucky thing to do man.
You know what this is? This is a stinger.
Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.
It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.
She was kind of tripping me up, cause she was, um, I was trying to get something going, when I was over her with the gun, and she like kept changing the story.
So let's meet the warehouse! Let's get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear?
No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.
Why not? It's part of the sales experience.
People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana's investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I'm sure that's what she would have wanted. Does want.
Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today.
You don't know what Diwali is? Wow, Jan. I'm surprised. It's the Hindu festival of lights. I just assumed you'd be familiar with it. It's the most sacred and honored Hindu holiday in the world. It's like Christmas, Easter, and Halloween---
That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.
[Jo Bennett enters with two humongous dogs, everyone stands to welcome her except Dwight] Why hello!
Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my God! [laughs]
I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?
Hey, guys, guys, guys. [steals a cherry from waitress passing buy] Watch this. Ready?
Let's get back to the matter at hand.
Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?
Yeah, she does - she loves purple. [Dwight sniffs it] Does it stink?
Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay... you're a jackass.  [to Pam]  Hey, hey, you know what?  You're just as stubborn as your mother, when you don't wanna do something you just don't do it.
You know what?  I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office.  The only thing that makes any sense.
Hey, Pam.  Do you need me to walk to your vehicular transport?
That's what she said. [Jim mouths these words along with Michael] The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does 'redacted' mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked 'redacted'... ?
Well, it's not exactly fair. He's got all of his weight that's helping him go down.
I haven't thought about you having to go back to Nashua.
[into mini recorder] The fundamentals of business by Michael Scott. Over one billion sold. More than the Bible, I'm not surprised. Chapter one. The businessman...
And that's it. That's me. That's who I am.
No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time.
We Don't? Well, why have I been separating the trash into whites and colors?
No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I'm gonna pass, I'm gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.
We tried and we failed.  Stanley, you may go.  Here is a box, for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place.  Fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free.  Pam, I'm gonna need some help writing a want ad.
I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.
I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!
No, you know what we're gonna do?  We're gonna take that and we are going to us it as a reward for the end of our competition.
Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair.
Oh, I know your hero. Yeah, saving you from Animal Planet Jack over there. [laughs]
I want you to say I'm an alcoholic.
Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.  So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.
Why do I like Hooters? Well I will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings.
Gabe, just go and have fun with Erin. But not too much fun! That girl's gonna turn my hair gray.
I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for.
No, that was... that was legitimate.  That was totally legitimate.
I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?
Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so...
[exhales loudly, looks out window and sees Katy] Oooh, alright I'll talk to her.
We are getting there folks. Slow and steady. [David Wallace walks in] Well, well, have we been blessed today. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. David Wallace! Whoo!
Anybody?  This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions.  Stanley?  Oscar, come on.
Jim Halpert. Pros: smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons: not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something.
I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God.
This place is not prison. It's... way better than prison.
No.  No, Pam.  I'm baaaaaack!  For gooood!  Kevin Nealon.
What do you guys think? [all start talking at the same time]
When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.
It's uh... two and a half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone.
Yes, yes, I ran out first. A captain is always the first one on the ship and the last one off the ship. And this parking lot is our ship when the building is on fire. So, I ran out onto the ship.
We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.
What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her 'partner' in to work? [to Toby] Would that be crossing the line?
That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.
Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't...
In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have sex. Does Holly feel that way? I don't know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having sex with me I'll know for sure.
This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.
Hey, you know what? [Michael and Dwight grab plates of sushi] Come on, come on, let's go.
Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.
Well, I'm not really one for making speeches.
No, Jan.  I've never asked for a raise in 14 years.  This is long overdue.  I wanna do it today.
There you are.  I don't think we have finished with my Inbox.
Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.
Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili's.
No, no, no, no. We'll find some, don't leave the party.
It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around.
Really? 'Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.
Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.
But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy.
Gets to go home. [everyone starts to do push-ups] Ooh! I say 'dance,' they say 'how high?' Here we go. Oh, no. No, no, no. Butt to high. [steps on Angela] Disqualified!
I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that I'm supposed to have. Thrilled.
Oh, here we go.  They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need?  I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special.  I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory.  [holds up painting]  And I have another one of them in the nude.  But that one is for me.
[off camera] Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. [rejoins the group, on camera] Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. [flash goes off before he sits down]
Okay, I will start.  Um, 'A.' [singing] 'A' my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell...  Damn it! What do we sell?  Um...
Hey, hey guys.  You know what I want you to do?  Shake hands, get over it.  That was not a shake, Dwight.
Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!
No, you're the best person for the job.  You're going to be great.
I am not. I just have had a bad day.  And I... okay. I'll be back later with the money. I'm just gonna leave right now.
What do you think?  What do you think of this place?
Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries.
Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.
Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?
Yes.  I have bags under my eyes, and I can't go to New York like this!  What do I do?  What do I do?
The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they'd come down, and they'd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!
Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.
Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity.  How is that not work related?
Good.  Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm  going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.
Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. I'm sorry. I just... I just wanted to make this a day to remember.
Good. You know, Ryan, you didn't have to get me a present.
[bending Luke over desk, spanking him repeatedly] You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!
All right. See you later. [backs out of the parking space] Ahh.
I'm already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back.
[on phone] Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica.
Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen.  I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag.
[Dwight looks confused to the camera] Were they in the missionary position? [Holly laughs]
Okay, alright. Hey, you know what? I would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage.
Oh, [taking it to heart] lazy. Uh huh.
No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I'm casting a movie and I'm looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?
It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them.
Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin.
Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.
[through the car window] Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so...
Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three?
[on the phone] Uh-huh, yes, I can do that. Absolutely! Perfect. Oh, I'm glad it timed out that way.
Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal?
So far, these are my leads.  A blind tollbooth operator and a twelve hundred pound catcher.  It's a start.
No no, I'll help you. I'll help you up. Here we go.
Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.
Yes, yes. What yes? A sale or a lead or...
[video dialogue] And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants.  Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home. [video says, 'Great Scott!']
I can't believe I pushed that... that guy's lazy ass around all day... until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That's... well... I got news for you, Albert. If that's your real name. The show's not over.
I really thought these people were my friends. My best friend since kindergarten, Elliot, that's a friend. Best friend ever. I should call him. Wonder where he lives.
It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.
OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.
Well some of us are trying to have a...
Oh yeah... I know... that's what I was just saying... that's what...
Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one. [thinks] OK, yes that would be bad.
I am going to scare these kids so bad.
What is a sales department? Oscar, what do you think?
Alright, do you mind if it sit this out?  I have so much work to do, I feel like I'm gonna blow my brains out.
[still talking like a robot] I... was just learning... to... love.
This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei.
Oh that so - that was really messy. He slept one night in your car too?
I have a very difficult decision to make.  It's like last week I was at the video store.  Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice?  It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.
Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.
Exactly.  Here, here are my sure things.  I blindfold her.  I take her to the Houdini Museum.  She chains me up...
Are you still taking the antidepressants? 'Cause it was a good idea. 'Cause it'll help. It'll help, man.
Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David.
What's the only thing worse than one HR rep?
Oh my God.  You're not going to be able to talk back.
Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?
Hey, hey Jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face.  Alright,  Just do it.
All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it.
I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?
I'm moving out to the burbs... actually, I'm moving further than the burbs, I'm moving to Colorado.
You know what, guys, let's just enjoy lunch.
Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.
Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving into together. Yay! [claps] Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend!
[covers phone, whispers to Dwight] See how it's done? [into phone] Thank you very much, sir. I don't think you'll regret it. [to Dwight] See what I did?
[in video] The Dundie award for 'Longest Engagement' goes to Pam Beesley.
Well that is... because... I am a genius.
Ha ha ha.  So where are you shipping...
Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button.
Yes.  My old friend Ryan Howard is coming back today for some big presentation.  Very, very excited.  He is my protege.  He is someone that I hand-raised, that I nurtured.  Um... he is like a prime cut of veal whom I nourished with my milk.  And now he is also my boss.  So, win/win.
Sit. Okay, just close your eyes. [massaging Holly's back]
Well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like Jordan and Pippin!
Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take a little look-see.
Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I'm going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise.
Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart...
Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.
Ed's Tires. Why don't you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.
[throws the projector out the window] Help!! Help!!
Okay. [hangs up phone] And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way.
No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.
We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his... when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do.  So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you can't get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket.
I can't hear you! [less applause]  Heard you a little bit less that time.  Must be...
All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you don't sell?
No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work.
All righty then, well I see you're going for the whole bored supermodel thing. 'Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. May I help you?' [takes a drag from an imaginary cigarette] Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.
Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?  I work too hard.  I care too much.  And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.
I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says.
Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised.  Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin'.  I know this place.  I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have.  It's home, you know?  I know the challenges this county's up against.  Here's the thing about those discount suppliers.  They don't care.  They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices.
New York real estate.  I started by looking for a brownstone, like the Huxtables had, [shakes head] but instead I found this very, very, nice place in Jamaica, Queens, mon.  It is on the last stop of the subway, which is wonderful, because if I fall asleep, I still end up at home.  It is a suh-weeeet one bedroom.  I have a roommate, uh, Vijay Chokalingham, he's a sophomore at Queens College.  He actually works in the Indian restaurant right below the apartment, so... free food, and the place always smells like curry.  So, win/win.
Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing?
Wait, hold, hold, hold... so it IS true?
Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie.
He gives the best back rubs in the office.
Well, I thought as the man that I should make the decision.
[fighting back tears] Yeah, Randy Newman's the best.
[approaching Kelly's desk, whispering] Stanley is having an affir.
Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle...
She was cute.  You know?  She was hot.  She was very hot.  She made love like a tiger.
Kind of in the middle of something here.
You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it.
Oh, God!  How could that happen?  How could... right in the middle of the carpet.
[to Brad coming out of the bathroom] Hey.
You know what? We're pretty much done here today. Why don't you just take off early?
I always keep a stash of bubble wrap at my house.  Some days, hectic, tiring days, I just like to go home and zone out and click on the tube and pop a few.  Very soothing.  [to the interviewer] Want to try?
Goooood morning, Viet-Nashua! Sales. Sales is what bwings us together, today. How do we deal with clients who say, 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn... about paper' and get them to 'Show us the money!' Well, we are going to find out today. Show of hands. How many of you are salesmen? Let's see the salesmen. [some raise their hands] Oh, okay. Well I know what the rest of you are thinking. Wow, yuck. Salesmen are the worst! They are awful. They are so arrogant. They think the whole place revolves around them. Handsome, good listeners, funny, Mr. Wonderful. So, okay, you're a salesman. What's, uh, what's your name?
