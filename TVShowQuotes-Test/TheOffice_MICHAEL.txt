Lynn, follow me, come on in.  For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone.  Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.
Heeeeeere's Santa! Hey little girl, what would you like for Christmas? Ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, I see. [points to Pam's' pregnant tummy]
Stop it! Stop, stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it.
Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes.
So, how you been?
Thank you!  Wish me luck!
I'm kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn't interrupt.
What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm.
That was Packer!  Oh, you're... you are dead.  You are dead, my friend!  That is hilar... Oh, God!  Of course it was you.
Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months.
There are five stages to grief, which are [glancing at computer screen] denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.  And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad.  And that's   hard.  And it's making them all angry.  And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance.  And if not acceptance, then just depression.  If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job.
You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret.
That makes sense because he has elfish features.
Deangelo's great. I love the guy. But I'm not sure he's a great fit for the office. And also, I'm not sure if I love the guy.
I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me.
Get lost.
Of course. You're always working hard.
No, sweet cheeks.  We need someone who's actually made a sale.  Andy, you go.
[no longer talking to Dwight as Wallace] Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that.
Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.
Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So...
I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad.
Her passwords aren't going to be Dwight, Dwight. That's stupid. Okay.
All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'.
Sounds like a good dentist.
We're doing this because of you.  So why don't you just go stand somewhere else.  [to Ryan] Hey.  Hey.  You shaved?
Okay. Old friend, like, you've known him since kindergarten?
I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then it'll suck.
So, the copier.
No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.
[turns to other restaurant patrons] I'll have what she's having!
I don't know.  What?
I don't care if he goes and files a report and says that we're nothing special because I think our future is very bright. We have only just begun.
[Walks out of the Ladies' Restroom] Let's go. The men's room was disgusting.
Okay! Calm down.
Yeah.
It won't.
What'd you have, Stanley?
I would like your undivided attention, please.
Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock.  And when I came to, I had an epiphery.  Life is precious.  And if I die I want my son to know the dealio.  The dealio of life.
Ok. [Removes biscuit, leaving only sausage, egg and cheese.] Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.
That is ridiculous.
Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!
[laughs] I am flattered. That's Johnny Depp.
You just said, let me uh... check my notes.  You just said...
[to Holly] Can't set 'em up like that.
Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy...
Hey. Wow.
Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for.
Just remember folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing.
I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'Nard Dog. Who let the 'Nard Dog out?
I'm starting my own paper company.
Yeah.  And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it's creating a bit of a hostile work environment.
[counting cash] Seventy, eighty, one, two three.  Eighty-three dollars.  Still a lotta money and I'm going to ... [moves money after seeing workmen walk by] ... I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it.  I will be taking Jim's clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest.  Let's see who winds up with the cash, shall we?
Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore. [sighs, takes sucker out of his mouth] Wanna share?
That was funny.  Let's go do it to somebody else.   Ayyyy!
I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.
Yeah, she does - she loves purple. [Dwight sniffs it] Does it stink?
Hold it, hold it. [forcing door closed] Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?
Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?
Earlier today this office needed a Santa. And then it needed a second Santa. And then it needed a Jesus. And now, it needs a Michael. And that's one suit Phyllis cannot fit into.
What, um... what do you think of role-play?
Mmm... No. That was Yoda.
Come on. Let's not be gloomy here man. We're all in this together. We're a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobody's coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend.
Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.
[holding up a binder] A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.[in a comedic voice] My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.
I am going to run three possible date ideas by you and I want you to tell me which one gets your blood percolating.
[Jim has the ball] Jim! Jim! Right here! [runs into the elbow of the guy guarding him] Ow! God! Hold it!
Okay.
Jeff was my mother's boyfriend, who she married.
I'm gonna have it one of these nights.
That's what she said.
There is no such things as monsters.
Don't...
I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid.  Sold in record time.
Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?
Mm.  Me too.  Okay, let's get this started.
Toaster Oven 101?
Agreed?
Well then my man meat, he shall have.  There you go.  Deliciousity.
Mmhmm, bravo!
[pulls out a recorder and speaks softly into it] T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert. [starts to cry] You started with this company, as a fine young man...
What can I do?
Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies.
I still have to look at this stuff, guys.
Um, sort of a spy, thriller...
Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.
Give me...  Give me the diary.
Doesn't matter.  Out please!
You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info.
Oh, you move on.
I have a deposit.  Alcoholic.
[looking through papers in the complaint box] This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.
Hey, Josh, how ya doing?
Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?
All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution:  Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.
So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!
No, no, no.
I don't know.
What?
Ryan's about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one.
Oh, wow!  Whoa!
Ahaha, Yep! [Dwight looks down depressingly and rubs his new goatee]
Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard.
It's Grrrrrrape! Soda.
Hilarious. Hey.
A cute little religious type, someone who wears a uniform, or...
[speaks in a Yoda voice] Much advice you seek. [regular voice] Do you know who that is?
The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.
Ah, right here. Three Stooges. High five. [Michael and Ryan high five] Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. [camera cuts to Pam then back to Michael] Now, who was the one before Curly?
I won't.
If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar.  That's how it works.  They inherit things through the breast milk.
Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor.  And I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor.  Erin, read the first one.
What did I say?
Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it.
So I'm less funny than not funny at all?
It's about you. It's about you. Go!
[on sidewalk] There it is! I saw it! I saw it! He went right by! You missed it! [all groan]
That's... I, I think that...
Well, I don't really have two heads. So...
What?
I know, I know, I'm sorry, but if it's not a big deal we should just-
That's a lot of noodles. How much sodium do you think is in that cup? This place used to be full of hookers and porn shops and it's not that way anymore. There's an old building. That one hasn't been torn down yet, but they will. They'll get to it.
I can't hear you! [less applause]  Heard you a little bit less that time.  Must be...
I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'Fundle Bundle.' Okay? Without further ado, Ryan?
Um, guys, where you going? Pam, show's just getting started.
Do you remember what color my eyes are?
Carol?
A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is 'Jamaican Jan Sun Princess.'
Oh, [taking it to heart] lazy. Uh huh.
The winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.
BFD. I'm a screenwriter.
Are you calling Karen?
It's a celebrity tournament.
OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.
Ah.
Okay, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for Cat's Cradles. Burned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets.
Oh wow another living room!
I know.
Well, let's...
They make the best Maine lobster in the world. You'll love it.
Ok, I'm fine, no I know, I'm good, I'm good, it's just.
Oh, thank you.
What is it?
Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary.
Is somebody there?
You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave.
Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut [closes box].
Yehhhehh.
Just words. Inspiring words. [under breath] Not a contender. [out loud] For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.
Lowest in town.
Okay, smarty pants, then why?  Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?
How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That's all you need.
Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?
Yes it was.
Um...
Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it.
Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.
I just, I fell in love with those kids.  and I didn't want to see them fall victim to the system, so I made them a promise.  I told them that if they graduated from high school, I would pay for their college education.  I've made some empty promises in my life, but hands down, that was the most generous.
Yeah, I hate that.
Well, if you hadn't stopped the scene, you would have seen where it was going.
She's not playing the game.
Well, that figures.  So how did you deal with people not liking you?
James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn. [clicks tongue]
No, you said something, didn't you?
You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here.
No, not at all.  Nope, come on.
Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.
Well, hello to you, too.  Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's.
Yeah. Quiz me.
It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident about a decision in my life.
When did this happen?
How long till we get to Mexico?
It's not. They're not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.
I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we're through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!
Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads...
What do you say?
No, no. [blues piano playing]
You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch. [in pirate voice] It's me own damn fault. Woman in every port.
...what?
[to Dwight] Mmm-kay.  I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.
We're just friends. [approaches Holly and AJ] Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know.
OK. Do you want me to repeat that?
No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing.
Uh...
Mmhmm, tell her she can't have sex for six months.
Well, it's, it's-
Inventory's at the end of December.
Okay.
No, I will ex-squeeze you.
I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all.
I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?
Fourteen years.
Please don't do that.
Oh, hey, do you still work here?
Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool.
Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It's over. It's done. But my punishment is ... um ... worse than hell.
Oh hi. I'm sorry, just a sec. [whispers] Erin, you're supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?
Yeah.  I withdrew too.
Oh, God. Oh...
Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.
Did everybody know about this but me?
Okay.
No, you don't. No, it - [sighs] What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?
Yes. Count to three, please.
I'm going to give Erin $15.
Yeah.  Ummm, hmm... True.  Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor.
Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please. [Ryan is working at the bowling alley] It's Michael.
I have been a loyal employee for a long time.
Yeah!
Explain that.
I'd like to make a wish.
And a woman-
Oscar's a douche.
Yeah. Oh... oh!
Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product... the progidal... my son returns.
Wait, what?
If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago. [growls]
Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle...
Good luck. That is a tough crowd.
I would love to take them all to Jamaica, but is that good management? Yes. But is it the best management? Well, I can't afford it, and corporate won't pay for it. So who's the real criminal?
Here's the door. Here's the door.
You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.
[talking over Jan] No, Toby is terrible.  Toby is the worst human being I've ever known.
I want to come to work.  But I need you to come and pick me up. [Jim lunges across Pam's desk and puts Michael on speakerphone]
Okay, put her through. [Deep voice] Jan Levinson, I presume?
Yeah. I saved 3 years salary.
I don't either.
Yes.  Thank you.
No. Don't like that.
Dwight just got Howard Family Dry Cleaners.
Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and... [awkward silence]
No.
Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.
No...
I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box.
I am saying... that... maybe I was drunk.  Did you ever think of that?
Old fashioned meet market --
Well, okay...
Yeah.
Good work. I'm proud of you. [Pam and Oscar leave] Mother-
I did!
[sighs]
Tonight's so...
All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!
Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance?
I'm digging.
Ye-ohh.  Ye-no.
There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard. [laughing] He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs.
I know. I don't wanna get ahead of myself, but I think I want her to meet my mom.
Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really don't wanna be up there right now.
Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would've turned thirty. That's just - that's just depressing.
[in the office, crosses Dwight off his list. He has paint in his messed up hair, and is containing his laughter]
Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.
No, Pam.  The press is just gonna find out by themselves.
Wikipedia... is the best thing ever.  Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.
Forty... I'm in my forties.
One more hour.  Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I don't know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya don't, we could hang out.
Da  na na na na!!
...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?
Okay. Am I shiny?
...calendar.
Oh no! Say it's not so, Jo, we're gonna miss you, we're gonna miss you so much!
[playing Jan's message] 'I guess I missed you.' I guess I missed you.  So, she misses me?
I'm staying in your--  Come on, Dwight.
Oh my God! What if I did?
And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.
Oh, ok. Alright.
Yeah.
All right, Andy, please.
Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your penis. [everyone is shocked] [exhales]I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.
Yeah, I know.
[waving to Christian]  See ya.
Don't. Don't. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? She's got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people.
What?
Yeah?
Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. [under breath] And choke on it.
Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?
Here's what I was thinking. The following weekend, I drive up.
No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy.
I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.
Hmm.
Show time! It's show time!
I'm just having a little exit interview.
Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It's what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.
How 'bout a professional volleyball player who models on the side?
[standing with Holly next to 'Welcome to New Hampshire' sign] Oh, it's really cold here.
No, God, no it's not!  What is the matter with you?  Is that the beak!?
[sitting on the floor behind Erin's desk, sighs] Ohhh... mmm...
So I'm not in trouble?
[feigning accent] Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl?
I'll call him. I'll call David.
You're back. What happened?
Okay.
Okay, then I want Pam back.
Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I'm completely overwhelmed.
Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim?
I am makin' it happen, sergeant.
Ahhhh...
That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry.  Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.
What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point.
It's actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this. [Lies down]
What? [toilet flushing] What are you doing in there?
This is Michael.
All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck.
Okay, let's get personal for a second, shall we?
Toby, come on.  Let's go.
Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I'm going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance.  One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster's Dictionary defines 'wedding' as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride 'Mawige...
Oooooh, my life!
Why do you hate her?
Yeah, sure.
Why don't you wanna go tonight?  What... all your friends are gonna be there.  It'll be fun.
What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.
... customer service is a Hindu person.
What are you doing?
[watching Toby at Phyllis' desk through his office blinds] Look at him.  With his stupid face.  Stupid... tan. No.
We will demonstrate on Pam.
No he's not right. We're not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine.
Well you get the picture.  Thanks Pam.
Hey Ryan? [Ryan watches Montgomery Flea Market ad on YouTube] Could you get to that copy from before?
I don't know, same old stuff.  Same old.  Boss just been ridin' my ass.
There is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company. But 70 percent of me is water, and the other part, the real part, the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and, if I can be crass, makes babies, that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba -
Okay, let me tell you a little story. When I was on vacation, I met a man named Bavon. And Bavon takes people parasailing. And you know what he said to me? He said that he loves going to work every day. How many of you can say that you love going to work every day like Bavon? [Dwight and Andy raises hand] No one.
Thank you.
How much time do you think you'll need?
Let's do it!  Drop that sucker.
Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I'm a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years.
Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.
I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...
We saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met Michael Klump.
Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.
[grabs different remote from the table] Well I will turn up the volume.
[walks into room] Okay.
I don't feel bad.
Hi Dwight.
Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.
Wow.
And now, I realize that you can program or download any ring you want. So, I'm a little overwhelmed.
I'll get some punch. That looks delicious. [shoves Santa hat into punch]
I learned a lot about women today.  And any man who says he totally understands women is a fool.  Because they are un-understandable.  Jan and I broke up. Why?  Because she didn't like one message I left on her voicemail?  But that is her peariagative.  I thought I understood women, but maybe, can't believe I'm gonna say this, maybe, women don't understand themselves.
Ha! That-- I am not known for that!
Whatever you guys did earlier.
I'm asking Pam to do it, please.
Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!
You ever read this? [holds up Green Eggs and Ham]
I lied to Kevin. Holly and I can never be just friends. I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and I'm going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number one: 'Holly, you and I are soup snakes.' The-and the reason is... because... in terms of the soup, we like to- that doesn't make any sense. We're soul mates. Holly and I are soul mates.
I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin.
Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.
They used to make stuff in America, Andy. But we're falling behind, did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir.
Yes, I will. Because I always know how to get through to him.
MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage. [Kevin giggles] Can he do it? I don't see how he can.
[from the walkie-talkie] We are in a stairwell.
It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look who's here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly.
Hi.
[putting his shoes back on, talking to the camera crew] Well, I guess this is it. Hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. Alright... Oh! [pulls out his mic from his shirt] This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest. [he hands them the body mic, when he speaks it is inaudible now] That's what she said! [waves goodbye and walks off to his gate, halfway there Pam comes running up to him and they hug for a while. They say their goodbyes to each other, and Michael walks off for good]
...kind of [retches] Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.
I will do my job to the best of my abilities.
Well, you are boner-ific. [Donna laughs]
Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.
Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam.
Yes!
Good work.
Yeah, you should see her naked.
[in his office on his cell phone, talking in a fake high voice] Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.
Because I wanted you to come to me and say, 'Wow, he is so great.' And I was gonna say, 'Well, it's in the genes.' And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is.
Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don't worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha...  [bumps into something] ... ha ha ha.
No, this is my quest.
Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.
This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, it's about murder.
Wait a minute.
Nice!
With that I can buy... half the menu.
Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off.
[Jan walks in on Movie Monday] Hi Jan!  Hope you brought the Milk Duds!
You are doing it.
Okay.  I promise.  [Pam starts to walk away] For the record your mom came on to me. [Pam turns around and slaps him; he gasps]
...uh, no.
That is just so disgusting!
Don't you have some sort of chaser or gobbler thing that you can send out that's able to eat up that other emails? I read about something like that. Well, I am in America and I am online, so I do think it involves you. Uh-huh. And if I were a subscriber, would then you be able to send out the gobbler? I'd... Yes, I will hold.
Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.
OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.
You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference.
Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?' Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So it's kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special.
Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.
Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And don't sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away.
No no no.  The only signal that I am sending is:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.
You're welcome.
OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not 'packaging.' Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?
Crazy world.  Lotta smells.
Eh.
Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think I'm getting you...
OK.
They're back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam! [reaching out with hands at chest level]
Okay, see you guys. [Sees Jan] Hey, how you doin'?
...'Cause I'm the first to to find out. Nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them. Well, good. How are you holding up? Want me to come over? [Jan hangs up]
Don't say cocks. Oh, what is your name, my fair lass?
I'm not gonna date a 55-year-old woman.
Yeah. Correct. Um... What gives-what-what gives you the right?
[holding Jan's breasts] Remarkable.
You call that a sales call? My God, what have they been teaching you?
If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.
You don't know what it is. [Laughs]
People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable.
Captain Jack has a problem with authority.
[confused] Stanley was on your group date?
It's a fake wheel, dummy.
No, no, really not necessary.
[at Hooters] Oh man, you should order milk. Get it?
[whispers to Meredith] I'll be down in a minute. [walks over to Toby] Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?
[fighting back tears] Yeah, Randy Newman's the best.
... because they had a much scarier safety presentation.
All right. Well if you need me, I'll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no.
OK, OK.  Good.  I'll catch you on the flippity flip.  Bye. [hangs up phone]  He's busy, he'll call me back when he's free.
[emerging from convenience store with two ice cream sundaes] Hey, look at that. Fun, right?
Okay, go back to the annex.
Stanley's wife is out of town.
Oh, that sounds awful.
Right there. [Michael points to computer screen.]
Well, this...
That's good.
You know what, I'll pay for it. I'll pay for the party. It doesn't matter. This is way too important. People, Holly's coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work.
You get to look at her.  Why don't you hold out your hand. [hands Brad paper] Tell me what you feel.
Toby, can I really tell you anything?
You're so lucky! Good one... [clapping]
This is Tito.
...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back.
I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you.
Is she crazy in bed?
Listen man, I am so sorry.  I had no idea.
Home owner. About to join an exclusive club, Dwight. Maybe some day these people out here will know what that feels like. Maybe not. Who knows? Not my problem. [groans]
Well, then, Gould wasn't kidding.
Alright.
...We don't want them back, 'cause they're... stupid.
The human being man's name was Devon.
Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off.
[clears throat] No, hey, hey , hey. You know what I just wanted to remind you about the game today. One 'o clock. Big game, big game.
[to the guests] Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good.
No. We're only 10 minutes from the lake.
[shouting] Louder!
Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight?  And now we're wasting tape.  I'm gonna have to cut this all out.  Can you say cut?
Cancel it! Are you still here? [to Erin]
Yeah?
That's not in tune. I don't know if you can...
Jim! Jim! Jim, right here, Jim! Give me the ball! Ryan, cut! [Michael looks away and misses Jim's pass] Whoa!
Hey, you don't deserve her.
Well, thats...
I didn't say it to him. I said it about him.
And do your worst.
Don't bother Luke.
It's just a really important day for me.
[lowers microphone] Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Okay.
There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.
I can do that, it is my office.
I have a proposal, everybody. Listen up. Now, Corporate has been really breathing down my neck to make some pay cuts, but I refuse to fire anyone. So, I was thinking that maybe all of you would take a 10% pay cut and that would save the money. Yeah?
Yeah, I do. My word against yours.
Okay. Alright. Cool.  See ya in a bit. [looks at picture on Toby's desk] Oh, she's cute.  Cutie-pie. Back to work.
Ahhhh!  [sweeps toys off his desk]
Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing.
I need to pee.
Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself. And I will never do that again. Because I look at somebody like Jim Halpert and I think, that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper. Just like me.
Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.
Ohhh, wow. Look at that. How cute.
No, no, no!  Seriously, I don't mind sharing.
We're not-
Um, nothing. I just... I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you. [leaves office]
...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.
Really? What's going on?
We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers.
Hey--
Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie.
Heed. Heed.
I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls -
Ok. That's ok. That's not a problem. Ok, sweetie.
Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm... [hands over report]
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott, and... I... am in charge of this place... ahh, what'll make you... understand... I am... like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City.
[carrying the car seat] Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office: Assst...
Oh, well, then, email it to me.
No, no, no!
Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster's People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don't know. It's like [pause] Dave died or something.
Okay.  If I give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.
And you're okay with that?
No, no. I get it, I get it, I get it. A child is born, 'Oh, oh-hum.' A beautiful sunset, 'No, I'll catch the next one.' Right? Unicorn walks into the office, 'Oh, do you have an appointment?' [laughs] Okay, look Pam this is not meant as a criticism, but let me tell you what you're doing wrong. You are the voice of this company, right? And when clients call and you're not smiling they can hear that in your voice. It is a real turnoff.
No, I didn't. [to Jan] Huh, what? [everyone looks up at blow-up doll]
Okay. You can count on me.
Somebody, who I think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out. The 'Hottest in the Office' award goes to... ...Ryan the temp!
All right!
Really?
Divorce. Um... Okay, 'Meredith is so old...'
... Oh, God is that today?
I don't want to do that. [chanting continues] All right. [picks up phone and dials] She is going to freak out!
Ji.. why not? C'mon.
What table should we take?  So many to choose from.
I appreciate that, thank you.
Yeah.
As my associate.
No.
Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so you're dating somebody? Um... is it serious?
Yeah.  I just sort've had a feeling about him.  I have a feeling about you too.
Alright.
Uh, yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
Don't touch me this time.
That's perfect.
Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?
That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.
Yeah?
I don't.
No touching. Ah, I'm trying not to touch you.
How long is it?
How about some Splenda?
I don't understand.
I do understand it.
Kevin? This is my branch. You don't ask Charles. You ask me. I say, approved.
Okay, uh, well, one is taken.
Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples.  Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle.
Here we go.
That's like...
Frame him?
Let's keep going.  Keep it going.  Yep.  What do we have here?  We have somebody's piece of gum.  Somebody put a piece of gum in there.  This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company.  This is not a place for gum.  I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow.
Not if the printer isn't hooked up. You are making some very dangerous assumptions Oscar.
Good to see you.  Where's your saxaphone?
Uh-huh.
[knocks on Pam's hotel door] Hello, good morning.
Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly.
I will allow that.
Okay.
Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don't follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose?
What?
Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm... [blows out the candles]
Good.
Are you kidding me? Stop it.
You ready to do this?
No, I'm serious, we don't have to put up... Is it the dogs?
Mm-hm.  That is so cool how you have my name at the top.
Hey.
I... we're gonna have to... You... you want something better.
A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores? [makes a noise and gestures with his hands]
[thoughtfully] A statue.
I am the guy who roused that crowd.
Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets...
Pam!
Bluh.
We could go back and forth all day. It's not gonna solve anything.
So what was rule two?
Uh-huh.
Mmhm.
I don't... remember.
My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless it's from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully.
Uh, huh.
God.
Um, question: Does top salesman include uh, people who were at one time such outstanding salesman that've been promoted to...
Yeah, she does all that.
Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.
Uh oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-o!
What's the pink?
Entourage!
There are copies in the bathroom?
Who is he?
...was that he was a complete stupid idiot.
I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off?
I love that. I love that face.
Yes.
No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that.
The wildcard is dinner at a nice restaurant.
You look great! And you're a princess?
I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people.
Bye.
I don't know. Maybe.
Steak! Where's my steeaaak?
Up and over.
That got a big laugh.
Oh, oh! God. I'm sorry. Is there...?
Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right.
Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.
No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong.  And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways.  From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others.  And the bottom line, I am in the wrong.  I'm the bad guy.
No, I don't.
Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no?
All right, I'm sorry. God.
Yep, I did.  I did.  But I think... you should do it.
OK, don't get that. Please? [Pam gets up to answer her phone]
You made this?  Wow. [impressed] That's... that's very nice.
I know, I know, I know.  It went by too soon.
Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um... I think we're under an hour still, so...
Pam, please?  I have Country Crock.
Good to see you.  Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.
Yes.
Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate.
You are-
Was it the cleavage?
What's up?
Haha, I do! I just haven't hugged you in awhile [marks Cindy's arm with a black marker]
Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I'm sorry.
I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.
Pam, could you come get me?!
Okay... that's...
All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? [he holds up a toy taxi cab] Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.
Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.
You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can't say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something.
Keep simulating.
Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything.
Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough.
Nine dates. I said it on the second date.
You know what? Dwight, Dwight...
Okay, hey, you already have the job.  You don't have to convince me.
Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.
Well-
Yeah.
Having Luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years  a-  14. The last time I saw Luke was the opening day of 'Ace Ventura II' and that was '95, so yes, 15 years on the dot. Anyway, I lost him in a forest.
Okay, alright.  [he parks in an ambulance zone]
There she sat.  Her name was Pam.  She was a receptionist.  She was engaged to an animal.  There sat Jim.  He was a gawky, tall salesman.  The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able.  I made a family!  I got these two together, and I made a family.
You have stress?
Oh... God... [stomps] God! [throws hockey stick and yellow paper bracelet down] We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna... come here [hugs Kevin].
We didn't get it.
If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody.
People have been filtering in and out.
The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike.
[laughs]  Ohh...Nah.
I am Pam.  Spicoli guy.  Oh, God.  Names, numbers.  Okay. [walking into office] Whoa!  God!  Yuck, yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck!
I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again.
Everyone, now [bleep] calm down!
Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.
Yes I do.
[holding a chainsaw] And I turn it on and I say 'Prepare yourself for the Utica Chainsaw Massacre.'
Perfect crime.
Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.
Go ahead. Let me know if I miscalculated the size. I don't think I did.
No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party...
OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There's another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there's another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.
Got it for Ryan.  Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out.  Figured...
I went through Holly's things.
Alright, okay.  Deal! Okay, well... Jim?
No. Dwight. I'm fine.
I think better to be a happy idiot then a, um... Then someone who knows the truth.
[arriving at the first house] Alright let's go! [DeAngelo runs in the wrong direction] This way, this way! [Michael knocks on the door]
Yeah, way to go Phyllis. Nice work, per usual.
We will wait for the call and you will smile.  Let me try something, just while we're waiting.
I'm good, I'm good.
It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it.
That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?
You'll break it.
Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. [Donna laughing] Just kidding. Do you like mints?
-- I don't think it is.
You know what, why don't go around the room and say one memory of Meredith.  I'll start.  I liked her jumpers.  They reminded me of Kindergarten.  Jim?
Let's just clap. Ready? [clapping] Yeah! Yeah!
Take a sip of that. [hands Andy his mimosa]
Good. The Small Business Man?
Hey.
I dare you to.  Come on.
No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm calling- [coughs again] I'm sorry.
No. There's no one else.
Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan.
Really?
They act like I have no power.
No? okay, fine.
It's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
Well, hobbies--
No I'm staying.
You know what, Christmas isn't about Santa, or Jesus. It's about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, you're my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas.  And Stanley, you're our mailman. And I can't help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, 'How could they do this to us?'
Thank you.
No, I got it.
It's nice to meet you, too. It's an honor and a privilege.
I would love a place where we could meet older
Ah. Well. That's not true.
Well it sounds right, but is it?
That's not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. [no one is laughing]
And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it, you thought it was so wrong.
Oh, you know what?  You know what?  I shouldn't go in there.  I'm pretty busy, I should just...
Nice outfit.
Yes.
Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I'm Santa Claus. Welcome.
It's totally impossible!
Yeah?
Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. I'm sorry. I just... I just wanted to make this a day to remember.
Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?
No, no! It's not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up. They're a great audience.
I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.
What?
Love you, as a friend.
Okay.
David, wait.
Wow!
I'd rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party.
Yeah. Sorry you had to hear that. It was a lovers' quarrel.
[in the background] How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don't know either.
Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do. [runs water through hand]
No! It was like four years ago!
[in warehouse] Darryl said I could use the bailer because I'm leaving.
No it's not.
What?
Okay. [waits for call]
[standing in front of his office, sees that it is three forty five] Okay, everybody come on. Conference room five seconds! Let's go! Hurry up, let's do this! [Dwight runs into the conference room. All others follow]
When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer Holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire.
I am just saying that I don't think that you understand what I am saying.
That's a dog.
Did you know that gay used to mean happy?  When I was growing up it meant lame.  And now it means a man, who makes love... to other men.
I am not going to discuss anything outside of Dunder Mifflin business, period.' Okay. Now, why would Jan say she only wants to talk business and then make it clear that she is on her period? God, I don't understand women. How about a clear signal, right? Is that too much to ask?
[on the phone] Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger. [quick cut scene] All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake. [hangs up] That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so... [Clears throat] So that's the way it's done.
[sees Pam walking towards the door of the office] Um, Pam.
Now you got it.
I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he'd never heard that before he worked here?
So do I sign?
I'm good. Oh, my God.
You know what?  I'm gonna start dating her even harder.
Wait a second.  You're not into her?  Are you kidding me?
Let's celebrate.
Did somebody say 'baby back ribs'?  Hmmm? Hmmmmm?
They're gonna name the baby after you, you know. They're gonna call it Mema.
No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. Kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'.
It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.
Because of all the good work you've done.
Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this... I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here.
OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do... and we love it.
[on phone] Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks?
He grew into a man overnight.  Rare disability, still works. [sigh] A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?
Did somebody order a hooker over here?
OK, that's not helpful Phyllis.
I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.
Oh, there's Gill.  Oscar's roommate.  I wonder if he knows?
Ok, see you later.  Nice job, Bill.  Not.
Hey, do you need any help?
How do I explain this to Jan?
[video dialogue] And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants.  Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home. [video says, 'Great Scott!']
Oh. It's a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.
What do you say, Jan?
Oh, slow!  Oh, ho, ho, ho. [laughing as he passes Phyllis and Bob]  You guys are going so slow...
Okay. Thank you.
Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?
Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here.
What's wrong with me?
[laughs] I can't believe-ee. It's a miracle. She can talk!
The ring, 10-carat diamond, pops out of her mouth, hits her shrimp cocktail, right onto her finger. Million-to-one shot. All of the Greek people in the restaurant start screaming 'Opa!' Which means 'congratulations,' so...
Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay... you're a jackass.  [to Pam]  Hey, hey, you know what?  You're just as stubborn as your mother, when you don't wanna do something you just don't do it.
Never.
[Michael presses a button for Stanley] Peach iced tea. You're going to hate it.
Conflict!
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.
Yes, it is true.
Da  na na na na.
Shh, just stop. Here's what you do. You tell him that you're his friend and that you're gonna help him and that everyone's gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who's selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who's really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I don't understand a word of it.
I just don't want you to.
I am actually great with old women. In fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma... and then she met Harriet and now she thinks she's better than everybody.
Hey, everybody.  The next time you see me, I'll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado,  [clicks on small tape player] I would like to start saying my goodbyes [Song: Thank You, by Natalie Merchant plays in background] Okay. Goodnight, and good luck.
Hey.
Gin. [toast, sip]
Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. I'm just kidding around. I'm sorry.
Well, okay... And Andy, Andy who needs confidence  that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts. [other salesmen look outraged]
[imitating E.T.] E.T. phone Holly. Holly like phone?
I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids. [Michael sees it's the end of a street.] OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back,  should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it.
Hey guys. How's the workload on all of Dwight's old accounts? Handling it okay?
Can't wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now.  Come on.  Come on.
Jim and Pam and Cece really seem to be clicking. They are totally gelling. It's as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness. And good for them. That's great, because, you know, the paper industry's not gonna last forever.
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!  No deal.  Not with Michael Scarn, FBI.  Michael Scarn doesn't make deals.  Michael Scarn shoots and then asks questions later. [blows on his fake gun]
Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much.
Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?
Smart as a whip! Yes! [holds up hot dog packages] These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.
Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.
So what?
Yeah. Do you have any ice?
But before that, I have to do my presentation.
Very good.
What's going on?
No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it.
Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there.
Grab you here.
Just stop it. [slide of Michael & Carol kissing] What's the... oh, whoa! [laughs] Where did that come from?
No, no, no, no. We'll find some, don't leave the party.
Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a...
Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or?
How pleasant. You can...
Let's, yes?
Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.
The important thing is... this kept us secure people.
Well, we don't really do rap sessions. We kinda do... [Erin shaves Michael] god... we sorta do more of like powwows or-
Oh, that's not appropriate.
No, no, no, no!  Out, out!  Idiot.
Nope. The opposite of that.
No. No. That's not how it works.
To the left?
Cruise control.
Lethal Weapon?
Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue. [Hank takes some jellybeans from Pam's jar] Yeah, take as many as you want.
Wha - that's, I hate her.  Wha - God!  Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha - OK, all right, fine.
No Gould?
I think I know what's going on.  Ryan believes that there is some sort of special 'boss water' that he gets to drink now.  And there isn't.  But, um... don't tell him.  Don't tell him that.  I don't want to jeopardize our friendship.
[hangs up and composes himself] Yes, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm, I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I head to the airport at four. [looks at the list of members of the office, with some names crossed out] And I have said goodbye to half of them.
Pretty disgusting.
I could have helped.
And business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best.  Actually better than a five-star hotel 'cause you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine.  I think I am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce.
You know, when I hired Kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse.
Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick. [opens phone] And you don't have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it?
This isn't Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap.
No.
Who?
How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you.'
Hey, hey how is Alan?  Tell Alan that the Mets suck! Okay? From me, big time. Go Pirates!
What is Diwali?
Who's, uh... Who's next? Who we got? Whooo...
Ex-husband, you have to let it go.
Hey, hey, hey stop it.  Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no.  I kidnapped a kid.
Ah.
What if they made out? In front of everybody?
I didn't hear you. [laughs]
Shut up, Nick.  What a weird thing to say.  Weird I.T. nerd.  Don't get revenge on me, nerd.
This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?
Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He's been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo.
Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake.
Darryl. There you go. [hands him the Santa hat] You earned it.
Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I don't think I ate for three days. [Michael passes out]
Alright.  Oscar, got big plans tonight with-
Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great! [giggles] Thank you my friends, she is perfect! Ahhh, Dwight, may I have your chair please? And, um, some singles, if you will! Allllright. Nnnnn-dink! [puts single into delivery woman's pocket, giggles] Okay, um, alright. This has arms. Is that gonna be a... is that alright?
Shut up!
[rapping] I'm MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. She's DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat!
Yes, it's mine.
Oh God... okay alright. It's time to go it's time to go. Jim, let's go. Come on!
Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close.
Everything's wrong.  The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?
Hey there.
Yeah, that got a little out of control. Jan's taking a break, which is fine. I'm doing the same, just chilling. Getting my mind off of us. She's right. I need to be more professional at the office. When I'm at work, I need to focus on work. I should call her ex-husband.
I have a laundry machine!
Absolutely but not really.
Disruptive.
Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.
That's... they always give an ultimatum.
Oh, my God. That's a piece of cake. That's a piece of cake. Oh, 2%. Jeez, that's good.
And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.
Hey, right?
I don't know, nothin', what's up with you?
No, I want you to pick me up.
... Dwight, they embarrassed us...
[still talking over PA] Toby Flenderson to the principal's office. Your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets [Jim stands up, puts scissors in back pocket] because they are yellow and they're wet with your urine.
I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.
What a disaster, this whole thing.
All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it.
OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.
How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything.
Oh, yeah, that sounds good.
Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman...
Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.
Discipline. Kinky! [Laughs] All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.
You know what? I'm going to stay here as long as it takes.
And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax.
Tomorrow I want everyone to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. Alright?
Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now.
One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift.
Nein! I'm greek! My name is Mikanos.
It's Jim, Okay? Yes.
Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?
Well...
[fumbles] Thank you. Oh! Got it. Ok.
Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?
No, what happened with Donna?
Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager?
Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great!
Michael Scott.
Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up!
You leaked it?
[sighs] Come up with a joke that I can use, okay?
Okay, go, go, go, go!
Okay. I'll see you in a bit. [whispering] She's pretty cute isn't she? See you in a bit.
Oh, my God, Dwight.
No!
W-why did you...
Oh, I don't know. Maybe after I finish writing, producing, directing, and hosting your awards show. All right, just relax, keep your pants on. Unless, of course, you're in the bathroom and you should be able to take your pants off in that case without Creepsville Central spying on you. Good.
Yeah.
Pamela.
Don't! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.
Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night?
You are telling me now that there is nothing in it.  Okay, great!  Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?
Hey, uh, no, please? You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do.
Is it?
Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Let's go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift.
Get up here, Dwight.
[Toby running to get on the cruise] Hey! What's wrong with you? You missed the boat.
Nope, that's Tuesday.
Assemble a sales team. A dream team.
Mmm mmm! Remember the 15-scooper we had last week? Wasn't that good? I was Scooperman, you were Scoopy-Doo. Remember what you said? You were laughing.
Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.
So check out how we live
You can do the old way or whatever you think would work. [phone rings]
I'm not asking the temp for an extension unless I really need it.
[pointing to group of young adults laughing] Look at that. Look at that. That's fun. We need to do stuff together outside of work. Let's go help Africa. Let's go build an airport. We'll start small. We'll have a car wash. We'll send some cheerleaders to regionals.
I'm kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, it's just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room.
[singing] You down with the Dundies?
You really don't get it, do you?  You don't understand these people.  That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.
Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better.  I'm not in this for the trophies, but...
I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.
Yeah, I don't even know why I said booze cruise. I don't even think there's booze on the boat.
I have my passport. [pats jacket pocket]
Yes we do.
Ryan?
And it also helps if you've had five shots.
Good.  Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm  going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.
I mean you can tell.
Wow, you're kidding me!  Do you wanna talk about?
50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know,  you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.
Are you talking to me?
Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.
Hi.
You know, I will be honest with you... about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn't feel like a priority. So I guess my question [reaches for paper in his pocket with questions on it] for you would be [reading off sheet] how many clients do you have?
All right.
There are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work. [spinning in chair] He is a fan of the outrageous. He loves to surprise! He loves... other things as well.
I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.
[laughing] It looks like a [more laughing] It looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm! He just accepted, accepted that I put all this work into it! [laughs more] He has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!
How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?
Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. We're moving to Colorado.
That's funny.
Okay. I'll be right back. [goes to leave but walks back]. Okay. You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have my wallet and I was gonna try to dine and dash and that was stupid and I realize I can't do that to you fine people.
You know what?  Actually, let's go into the conference room.
Uh...
Yeah.
Oh. Isn't he terrible? May I? Here's the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It's not 1890 anymore. It's modern day. And women have sex before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That's part of life.
Internet.
Women in the workplace... yeah, translation 'I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls.' Oh! Sorry. 'Women of the workplace.' About what? I don't know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh!
I've been putting money into CDs for years.  I bought music that I didn't even like.  No. [shakes head]
Dwight, you ignorant slut.  Depression is a very serious illness.  Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year!  According to a 2004 study!
Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business! [all four of them sit in an empty booth with small Dunder Mifflin sign]  Hello!
Mm-hmm.
What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.
Fire guy. Don't start any fires, Ryan.
You are lying right now.
Excuse me. Yes?
So... high five me. We're back. To a happy... [grabs Holly's hand] look at those! Mittens. Are those a present?
Hey, guys, guys, guys. [steals a cherry from waitress passing buy] Watch this. Ready?
Here's the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. That's probably throwing you off a little bit.
[bent over] I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it. [Creed,Stanley, and Oscar pass by in the cab and get out at the finish line]
Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss.
Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza.  Please, thank you.
Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!
What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?
Listen to me. I like you so much.
Crisis Management Squad.
Oscar, enough with the girl talk please.
How do you know Michael Clump?
Here... Who's here?
[at same time as Pam] 4-9-1-7-4-5-1
No, no, no, no. I have the long sleeve. And actually, you know what we should do? We should wear them tomorrow to work, it'll be hysterical.
I suppose summer had to end sometime. It's sad, though, because I had a great summer. I got West Nile virus, lost a ton of weight. Then I went back to the lake. I stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, which hurt. That got infected even though I peed on it. Saw 'Inception.' Or at least I dreamt I did.
I think the engineer left.
[whispers] I don't know.  [normal volume] Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo.  I think I could back out of the sale. [Jan exhales] Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.
Hey David- [begins coughing violently] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I'm stopping now.
Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour. [Cindy laughs and walks away]
[overhearing Dwight's conversation] Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey.
[whisper] Hey... guys, check it out.  My own personal DVD player and 20 movies.
Well, he...
Yeah.
Whatever you say babe.
A hat.
Hey, everybody, I just got off the phone with David Wallace, and he has given us the go-ahead to make the first ever Dunder Mifflin television commercial.  Huh?
Mm-hmm.
I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot.
OK, I will play guy listening.
Okay.
No, no, no.
Ah, why, that's great news?   That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?
The aye's have it.
He said, we have been sold. [upset murmurs]
You've got it, you've got it.
Who's there?
Thank you.
I need you to do something for me.
What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?
Games have the power to distract people from stressful situations.  Battleship got me through my parents' divorce.  Operation got me through my vasectomy, i.e., my operation.  I don't think I would have been able to endure my breakup with Holly had it not been for Toss Across.
Oh, good.
No! Okay. [runs out the door] All right.
Just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules. But had to end, because the summer was over. For you...
Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me.
I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. [whispers] Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.
Oh, and I'm not?  Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun?  You guys just are workin' for the weekend, aren't you?  I'm workin' for the week.  Sales team, listen to me.  This is what we're gonna do.  I'm gonna up the ante a little bit literally.  Right here, I'm gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill.  The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash.  Sound good?
I can't say.
Got almost everybody. So... Holly's my family now. [you see video of Michael getting into the cab, and driving off. As the cab leaves, Pam drives in] She's my family. The babies that I make with her, will be my children. The people that you work with, are just... when you get down to it... your very best friends. They say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office. But I will. Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed. [You see Michael getting out and entering the airport, and going through security] I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that?
Yeah.
Dwight, your feedback is horrible.
Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I'm taking the bonus. All right?
Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends.
Come in.
Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first.
Mmmhmmm.
[talking over Jan] You're glad?
IHop.
Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don't even really have to worry about.
You're gonna be okay, it's gonna...
Just one joke.  Ok.  Well, if it's just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke.  Umm... let's see... choo choo choo.
Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled.  Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.
Really?
That's what she... a lot of places are like that.
Oh, oh, oh!  We'll get somebody to clean that up.
No, you lost those clients.
I'm just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever.
Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, I've heard women and children first. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully. And, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands.
...you just gots to get your freak on.
Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.
Oh coffee, that's too much. [Dwight drinks it]
No.
Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I'm turning to you my friend.
Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?
Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on.
Very much, Jim is my best friend. But it's his performance report... right here.  Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable.
Uhhh... nothing.
We ought to have this thing serviced.
I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- [Dwight whacks Michael with his shoe] Ow! What are you doing?
[laughing] No, I don't have time for this. Are you kidding me?
Shaaa-shut up. Hello.
This place is not prison. It's... way better than prison.
[extended Lazy Scranton video] Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon. Called my man, Dwight, just to see what was shakin'.
No, did you?
Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.
Are you mental?
Oh.
[with everyone assembled in conference room] Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors.
[whispers] I guess not.
I know.
I can't do the presentation, I can't- [voice cracks] ... just... oh... thinking about seeing him... and... thinking about... him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, God! [starts crying, covers his face]
Yes, Andy.
[misses a half court shot] Aw, come on! What is wrong with me today!? Usually hit those. [Dwight scores] Dwight, I was open. All right, let's go.
And they had no yams?
Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this. At all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful. And you are fun. And you are smart. [Erin is smiling] And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will. [kisses her head] And you know what? You don't need a mom. Because you have my number, and you can call me anytime.
Come on, egghead. Let's do it.
There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like...
Guilty! Guilty as charged!
Yep.
Take it up with Toby.  What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward.  And I want you to reflect.  And I want you to say something different.
That is a serious offense. Very serious.  As is toying with a man's heart.
It's not my decision.  It's mother nature.  And mother has very strict rules about fer--  [waitress comes over to pour water; long pause] -- tility.
No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.
Do you know anybody in the mob?
[muttering] Can't you?  That's so nice.
Come here. [hugs Oscar and In a low voice] Don't cash that till Friday, OK?
You have big plans for tonight?
Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? [Pam throws her hands up to indicate she has no notepad] In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.
[seems taken aback] Uhm...
Very cool.
I own a Chrysler.
What?
There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello [kisses Carol] You're about five hours early to the party. You're such a blonde. [laughs]
Yeah, maybe. [notices previous girl talking to another guy]
Federal and State. [no one bids]
Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.
Actually I don't get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so...
Yeah.
I know, Dwight.  I know.  I know.  I know.
Listen, Dwight.
Okay.
Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled.
Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.
Let's hear it.
[Phyllis embraces Bob ahead in line] Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?
I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just... [waves Dwight away]
And it's all inclusive.
Last gift. Kevin.
Well I believe in love at first sight.
Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.
Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?
Thanks Dwight.
Of course.
[on speakerphone] David, it was my understanding that I was not going to be managed.
Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here.  They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter.  They are treated like human beings. [sighs]
Actually I think it's not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah! [takes remote, raises volume] There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord!
No... She's in a coma.
[seeing David Wallace come into the office] Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in--- what's it gonna be, what are you gonna do? [Dwight runs into Michael's office] What's it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight? [David knocks on Michael's door and opens door] Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation.
[singing] OH! You believe in rock 'n roll. Can music save your mortal soul? And then [jumbling up the words] can you have to dance real slow. Well, I know that you're in love with him. 'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym. [more jumbled words] 'You both kicked off your shoes. Those rhythm and blues...
OK, good. Thank you. Wanna take our time, do this right.
It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.
Well, then it will be easier for you. But I, I still think it's worthwhile, to give a, give it a try.
[at puppies] Hey you guys. Listen to me. Don't get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. Look over there. See? They look cute. [at parrots] Hello! You guys are so beautiful. You're so colorful. I wish I could understand you. That's a metaphor I guess. [at snake] You are disgusting. You'll never find love. Yekkk. [holding puppy] Do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen? [licks his nose] I'm being serious. Seriously.
Yes.
Best day ever. Best day ever!
He was, but, uh... that desk was empty.  He'd come in and sit there sometimes.
Do I have a special someone?  Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of 'em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I'd pick them every time.  Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning.
I know, I know.  I think it's tiny.  I think it's too small if anything.  And that your glasses make you look ugly.
You are? What bar?
I was in that marriage arena, though.
Go ahead, ask me for a raise.
Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. It's not relatable. Nobody owns a farm.
No, no, no. And people don't understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality.
All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga! [Sasha and Michael laugh]
[pats Dwight and sighs] All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.
I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight.  All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.
Let's get down to business.  Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.
Oh, good. By yourself?
It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay?
Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?
I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point.
I know, I know. You're right, you're right.
What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry.
Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol' can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin. [Pam and Michael stare him down, he walks away] Actually a six pack. We're gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared.
Here's the toast. I'm gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.
He's not going to be a murderer.
I think I'm going to make myself some microwave popcorn. [humming] Press 'Popcorn.' Oh, that's gonna be delicious. I just love having popcorn in the middle of the afternoon. You know what? I could do with some hot chocolate as well. Oh, drat. I can't make hot chocolate and popcorn at the same time, unless, I can. Boom! Second microwave for le hot chocolat.
Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party.
Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.
He will be ushering you out.  [starts laughing]
God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?
Alright, you're going to miss the best prank ever.
Yes, you did.
What do you need?
He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him.
Go to your room.
Little trouble.  Yes.  Well, Jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift.
Listen, why don't we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability.
Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.
Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam?  You wanna come up and sing this one?  Need somebody else.  Takers, please.  [singing]  Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly?  Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb.  I was soft inside, there was something goin' on.  This part goes to the, uh, girl.  You do something to me that I can't explain.  Hold me closer and I feel no pain.  In every beat of my heart, we got something goin' on.  Tender love is blind---
I invited everyone in the office because it's not a day for just Jim or Pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate... my joy. And our, all of ours joys.
...for Phone. What?
The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip.
Just want you to succeed Pammy.  You know what, we shouldn't even be talking about business today.
Pervert.
Listen to me. It's two p.m. From now until four, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind.
Blah, blah, blah, blah...
No.
A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.
No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building!
Yes.  Actually I will tell you right now.  It's a club called Chatroom, and there's a password to get in, which is actually password.  So...
Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! We're dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock.
I'm Jesus, David, and you know why? Because Phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as Santa.
Dwight, what is your middle name.
Close them.
It's an advice question, and if you don't wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It's, um...
[unlocks door] Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!
No, Rose. They are not breathing.  And they have no arms or legs.
What's that, pipsqueak?
[watching Dwight eat breakfast] How can you eat like that?
Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay.
She can't talk to us that way.
Yeah.  Mmmmmm.
Please, Kevin.  You're fired.  [Kevin looks at Jim; Jim shakes his head]  Sorry, sorry.  Work with a bunch of idiots.  Shall we go?
Yes.
Don't blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?
Well, let's see. Um... Andy. Plays the banjo.
And Gromit. [David sighs] Jan? Is Jan there?
I think it does.
Goin'. Ok.  Where we goin'?  Doesn't matter.  Goin' to the go go. [nervous laugh] Oh-ok.
Both sad.
I don't know that.
Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?
Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?
What's happening to me?  I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together.  Jim Halpert, welcome.
No, no, no, means please don't. Please.
[on phone] Just compare last year's order to this year's. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. [Sasha walks in the door] ... Yes. We--yeah, they're very--they're different. [Sasha walks out] Yeah, we can stick with last year's, you're just going to have to supplement it, somehow.
Yeah I'm fine. Look, about you and Jim.
Okay, I will think about it.
Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.
Right.
No, no. What could possibly be wrong? Everything's great. Just keep living your lives. Everything's gonna be fine. [sighing] You are all such wonderful, innocent people.
Ready to do this?
Oh.
It's hard for me to imagine a scenario, where Meredith Palmer keeps her job and David Wallace does not - no offense Meredith.
Huh.  Sounds a lot like dentist.
Dwight! Dwight!
Hey.
I. Understand. Nothing.
Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month.
Football is like rock and roll, it's just bam-bam-boo... And basketball is like jazz, you know? You're kind of... Dupee-doo, dupee-do. It's all downbeat, it's in the pocket, it's like... [singing] Dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah...
Yes.
Hi Donna. It's Michael.
Kelly, Ryan looks great. You should be thankful that you...
Previously on Varsity Blues...
Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Who's your daddy? You don't know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don't. [to Jan] Come on. Let's go in.
No, uh, no. That was a test.  I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him?  How many of you said, 'Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.'
I'll stay off the grid.
Would someone just make the copy?
They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me... up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom.
For what?
He's kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny... and it was just horrible.
Ah, the old 'leave behind.' Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it's working.
Yeah. Well, it wasn't him.
Not really, look I don't know how to say this so I just will.
I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus.
[exhales] That's true.
Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.
it was fun. We had a good time.
Alright.
I don't believe you.
Because that's all it takes.
Your stupid friend zone.
Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?
[follows Jim into bathroom] You have to agree with me. [follows Jim back out] That's insane.
Alright stop, stop making him say it!  You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.
Uhhgh.
You knew about this all along, didn't you?
Absolutely. Is this mine or is this Chili's?
Geesh, Dwight!
MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!
Thank God.
I'm not going to slam you up against the wall.
No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault.
To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I'm calling it crime-aid. It's like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty.
That's insane.  We'll give this to somebody who will appreciate it.
And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out.
Yes.
I think this is going great.
[on phone] Yes, hello Mr. Flax this is Michael Scott, your daughter's boss. I am calling because I am going to have to fire your daughter Holly because she is such a terrible employee. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm actually calling because I'm in love with her. I love your daughter, and I have for some time. And I would like to discuss my intentions with you... which are to ask her to marry me. And I was just hoping you would give me your approval. And this isn't a joke. So call me back, when you get this. And I look forward to speaking. Thank you.
A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.
We will?  I can't.  I don't have an idea in my head.
[laughs] Try it on.
I also stole something off of her computer. A document called 'Dear Michael.'
Oh, here we go. This... um, here's the deal.
OK. [deep breath] Phyllis, you say? [snorts] Hmm. [suppressed laugher]
[sees Holly behind Jan] I was just going to...  I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene.  She smells like old tomatoes and dirt.
Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like it's not memorized.
I have a right mind to shoot you right in the head.
Thank you. Would you like some french toast?
I... this is Creed.
[sighs] How can he still not know?
You are gonna get seasick if you keep reading in here.
Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it's really sad because everybody thinks you're a loser...
[opening a delivery envelope, takes out slice of pizza which appears to have a section off the end] Okay... don't ask me how I got it, let's just say that I have... connections. [folds it in two and takes a bite] Mmm.  Mmm.  [with a full mouth and an Italian accent] I'm the Godfather.  I'm gonna eat this whole pizza.  And then I'm gonna kill you. [digs around in envelope, pulls out the rest of the slice] [indistinct] some cheese.  You gotta fold it up.  That's the way you eat pizza.
Here.
Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos.
What?
That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?
