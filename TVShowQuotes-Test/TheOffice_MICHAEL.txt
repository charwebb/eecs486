It is so much fun.  Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it...
The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.
Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here. [gestures to Pam to get up] Come on. Come here. Okay, okay, [to Jim] stand up. [Jim moves over in chair] OK, here we go. [holding both Pam and Jim's hand] Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.
Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.
Go ahead. Let me know if I miscalculated the size. I don't think I did.
It's from 'Sob-ray', our new owner, and it is to Sabre, us. I wonder what's inside. Scissor me. [Erin tosses Michael open scissors, Pam is appalled]
What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?
MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage. [Kevin giggles] Can he do it? I don't see how he can.
It was all made up.  Just someone come, ok?  Anyone.  Anyone but Dwight.
- since you made the trip out. And I got us reservations at Cooper's Seafood. You like lobster? You've had lobster before, right?
Once a week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay then we are... yes.
No, no, no, no.  We don't do that.  We don't do that.
I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.
[whispering] Hey, that looks good. Listen, about the tickets. It's sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of...whether or not I had them- [Holly covers Michaels mouth]
Today is Safety Training Day.  Toby is leading ours upstairs.  Yeauck.  But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat.  We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation to the warehouse.  And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity.
James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn. [clicks tongue]
Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.
[Darryl scores] Watch the long passes, you guys!
So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don't hesitate to ask. I'm right here.
Yes, I love both of those so much. A lot of 'em.
No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.
I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.
[on the bus] Hey. Hey. Is this the bus to Mexico?
Who wants to help the world one step at a time?  [Dwight raises his hand] Alright, good.
So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?
Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out. [hangs up] Bill Cosby.
Oh, oh, oh!  We'll get somebody to clean that up.
OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. [turns around a picture of Meredith in the hospital] That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing.
Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?
Attention, all problem sales persons. Jim Halpert... Dwight Schrute...
I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I'll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive.
Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem.
Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. We're moving to Colorado.
When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I don't care if you're a loser, or you practice bestiality, if Jo likes you, you are in. And I am in!
Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?
No, I'm always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25.
I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.
I just... you couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know?  I used to sit right here.
A cute little religious type, someone who wears a uniform, or...
Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.
Well, it's, like, well, it's, you know, when refine it, refine a character down to its essence,  that's...
[hangs up and composes himself] Yes, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm, I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I head to the airport at four. [looks at the list of members of the office, with some names crossed out] And I have said goodbye to half of them.
I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone.
No. This is my toast.  I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it.
Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute!
Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.
No, no.  I need two men on this.  That's what she said.  No time!  But she did.  NO TIME!  Guys, get on this.  Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.
Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she's hot!  And you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses. And that you were the blind one. He's the most... important thing in my life right now.
We Don't? Well, why have I been separating the trash into whites and colors?
Yes you can, you're single, I'm single. It'll be awesome.
[mumbling] Should I... turn, no. Do it again.
No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage.
That is my Christmas card. It's a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings.
Yes.  And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her. [laughs] Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals.
Ugh. Well, de-depends on how you define 'begin'. I mean, if it was from the first time we shook hands, that's like six years ago. If it's from the first time we kissed, that's like two years ago.
You are gonna get seasick if you keep reading in here.
[cheers loudly after cast finishes singing song] That was amazing! That was awesome! I auditioned for this. When did the cast list go up?
No seriously.  You should have an M&M, they're really good.
[picking up phone] Hey, what up, Cynthia? [lowers phone, looking terrified]
Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good.
Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food.
It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers. [DeAngelo jogs up and takes the Dundie and tries to go back to his seat]
[next house] Hey Toby! You suck! [throwing eggs at his house]
Comedy; it's funny.  It's Johnny Carson, Karnak.  It's, um, put it back.  Huhhhh, did you have Johnny Carson in your land?
Here's the toast. I'm gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.
Shut up, Nick.  What a weird thing to say.  Weird I.T. nerd.  Don't get revenge on me, nerd.
Oh! You didn't need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it.
Ok. Come on Jan. After all we've been through...
Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you. [Kelly sprints inside Victoria's Secret] Come on. Get in here.
And I want kids.  And you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.
I don't, I don't have to have that.
Yes, I have to begin every day by letting Jan know what I intend to accomplish, and then I have to call her at the end of the day to tell her what I
No.  No it's not.  I feel terrible about it.  I have been calling people 'faggie' since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake.  If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know?  I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing.  Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime.  And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude.
Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!
I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday.  Unless you're still sick.  So have a great long weekend.
Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time.
Okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry this guy's a temp and I should've told you that.
Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.
Yes, yes I do.  I love that song. [clears throat, begins to sing] First I was afraid, I was petrified.
Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.
No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?
My wish has come true, incidentally, because, you've met me, and you are happy.
Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. I'm just kidding around. I'm sorry.
On one hand I want to be honest with Jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand I'm afraid she's going to dump me.
Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.
I will have a girlfriend once she sees this place. I'm gonna get married and I'm gonna have kids.
Untrue. The heart is bigger than the skin. If you stretched the heart out, it would cover more than the entire body.
Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly she's not yo' ho no mo'.
I knew it. [Dwight and Jim walk in]
Think of it as part of your training.
[to Holly] Can't set 'em up like that.
If somebody doesn't tell me, I'm gonna start screaming.
Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again.
Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?
The key to a crisis is dealing with it right away. Like that aspirin company that sent out the poisoned aspirin in the regular aspirin bottles. If you don't act fast, you will lose customers.
Pam, come on. 'I like your food.' Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real.
I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine.
Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam?  You wanna come up and sing this one?  Need somebody else.  Takers, please.  [singing]  Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly?  Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb.  I was soft inside, there was something goin' on.  This part goes to the, uh, girl.  You do something to me that I can't explain.  Hold me closer and I feel no pain.  In every beat of my heart, we got something goin' on.  Tender love is blind---
Well, I... it could be either of us.
What is there to like? He's just, he's a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not?
I'm gonna back out of the deal. Nothing personal, but I feel like I have been taken advantage of here.
Ah, why, that's great news?   That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?
All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you don't sell?
It's not! It's not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Don't hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I'm so fit, or I'm a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good.
I bet you're not even aware that our own Kelly Kapoor, who works in...
What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem?
Yes you did. That's right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out.
What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...
Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you don't. Not even Sabre owns this place. It's a rental. I'm kind of sick of the attitude around here. I'm sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim... I think I am not going to give these to you. [Angela, Kevin and Oscar applaud]
We should have your contract done by Thursday.
[reads email] 'I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business.'
Thank you. All right, when we get a call I'll come back and you'll do the smile.
Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.
It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay?
Pam, I don't make the rules. [Pam walks out.]
He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse? [Elizabeth walks up in nurse's outfit] This is the reason we're here.
Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there. [clears throat] Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isn't tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight. [clears throat again] So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought [choking up, clears throat again] sorry. [laughs nervously] I think I have a frog in my throat. Um... [sigh] I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um... [Michael walks off stage, knocking over the snare drum]
[clears throat] Alright, so let's get this party staaaarrrrted.
Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say.
Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?
It's ok. We're having fun. It's not actually the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing. [Jim signals for making to stop] No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse. [Michael begins to lose his cool] Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'Who are your 5 friends?' and I'm, like, 'Uh... ' I didn't even know I couldn't even think. [realizing he's going downhill] Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don't even have Jan's cell phone number and I hate her! She won't give it to me. I was like, 'Oh, I guess I'm a loser. 'A luh-whooooo a za her'.  Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice.
You saw who did this and you didn't stop them?
This is Pam Beesly, representing our girl next door.  Pretty but nothing special.  You know, but she sort of keeps it real. What you might want to do, is if you could zoom in, like really quick zooms on her. Might be good.  [walking away]  Who else? [pointing] Oh, Creed... is the old guy over there. Don't look at him. You might want to use him to sort of get that Orville Redenbacher dynamic going.
They could call at any second now. [sighs] Oh God...I better call.
[looks at the clock to see it is three o'clock] Jim where is Pam?
Frien..sss...yes, you're friends with a hobbit, and... look where you live.  I mean, you've got it all.
Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here.  Everybody I'd like to introduce you to Elizabeth.
When I was Ryan's age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe... lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me.
When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say it's not different, but it's a different sensation.
[Michael leaves to answer his phone] Can you hold down the fort?   [on phone] Hey boo!
No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. Kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'.
Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too.
Pac-man [imitating the noises of the video game Pac-man eating dots]
No, here's the thing. Y'know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they're always putting up walls and I'm always tearing 'em down, just breakin' down barriers, that's what I do all day.  So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?
I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.
Gabe, just go and have fun with Erin. But not too much fun! That girl's gonna turn my hair gray.
Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal.
Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.
Yeah, happy times.  Come on.  Let's have happy times.
I miss the old Dunder Mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate.
You, are you sure you don't want a pony? You want a real horse?
Oh, no, no, no.  You're good.  It was clerical.  You're good.  Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.
Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart.  This is me, Jan.  This is me!
Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership.
[to Abby] Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?
It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.
Hey. You know what the best way of studying is?
In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.
All right everybody. I'm out of here. Jim, you're in charge.
What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?
Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here.  They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter.  They are treated like human beings. [sighs]
And perhaps the most important person to Indian culture, Sir Ben Kingsley. Because of him, the British left India, and then he became an actor like Ronald Reagan.
I'm going to be. [to DJ] Hi, I'm just going to get this for a sec... just a sec. [speaks in microphone] Um... everyone? I'm sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah... Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband.
No. No, not really. Not really, but they better not win.
So many things.  I don't know.  It's hard to choose.
I've got an idea: why don't you leave right now. Why don't you walk away from the room, 'kay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools.
Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?
I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.
No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.
I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here.
No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.
[Ryan grabs some shoes] Look what he's doing.
[from outside] Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up.
[video dialogue] And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants.  Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home. [video says, 'Great Scott!']
Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today.
But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model.
The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die.  You knew that.
[to cashier at coffee shop] Thank you very much. Our suspect has straight brown hair. She is wearing blue jeans and a black top. So... behold our bachelorette [cut to a blonde woman in a skirt]. Give her ten for looks and a three for her ability to describe herself. Hello, my lady. [woman walks right by and doesn't respond]
Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't...
Okay... [sighs] Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No, no!
That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier.
Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager?
[screams] Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!
Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail.
In the criminal justice system, the people are defended by two separate but equally important groups, the police who investigate the crimes and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories. Kun-kun! [imitates vacuum cleaner] I'm just a cleaning lady. Aah! A dead body. He wrapped his belt around his own neck. It looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation. Yeah, looks like everyone's tightening their belts in this economy. [humming theme music] Last time you saw the victim, was he happy? Last time I saw this John, he was-he wasn't a victim, if you know what I'm talkin about.
Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it?
He's not the worst, okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though. [starts drinking coffee] Ah! It's not cappuccino.
How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?
Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.
[sighs] No, Dwight.  I am worried.  A man's life is in my hands.
The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.
When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday.
You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.
And we are going to straighten this out.
It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.
Out of, like, 18 billion Americans, so, no worry.
Ok. [Removes biscuit, leaving only sausage, egg and cheese.] Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.
Yes, yes.  But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... if somebody...
Ryan is a temp, and that means that he could go at any time. Am I worried about that? Try scared to death.
You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.
I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.
I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?
No, I feel it's my responsibility as your boss slash friend.
Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.
No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. [points to her picture on the wall] Or the funny things that they can do, like 'where's the Beef?' [points to another picture on wall] [Jim raises his hand] Yeah.
I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, you'll be fine.
So how you feeling about the new company?
One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today.
Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. [bump fists]
No! Gosh! Dwight. [Dwight tries to hit Michael with his shoe again] Stop it, stop it! Stop it.
Oh my God! Run! Run! It's a setup. Setup!
Uhh, yes, I did, here's the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information.
I say, I say, I say, I say down Holly! I'll take it from here. I am beautiful. [hangs pictures of fat people on the wall, including two fat people on a bike, the Ghostbusters Marshmallow Man, Elvis, Martin Lawrence in Big Mamma's House, Jabba the Hutt, and a fat pig] They are beautiful. He is beautiful.  This big fat pig is beautiful.
Holly and I are dating. It's been a week, and I still can't believe it. [sighs] It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can't work for it. It just comes to you.
No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong.  And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways.  From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others.  And the bottom line, I am in the wrong.  I'm the bad guy.
Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!
Yeah, but no, seriously. Uh, you know, he's not a member of the full staff so, uh, Ryan you wanna just step outside?
[on phone] Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed. Umm, It's all-inclusive...
[coming out from his office] Hello, may I help you?
Well Stanley, maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well.
Honey and jelly sandwich time. [removes lunch from fridge]
Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?
[holding up knife] What is this called again?
Oh, my God, this is agonizing.  Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?
Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.
Ow! [grunts, stumbles to his feet] You never forget. Whoo!
Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea.  Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, 'This might be kinda fun.'  And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.
Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.
And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.
I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king.
Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else.
I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems.
Okay, well, I really think that... [dial tone beeping]
These are not my shoes. This is just like that show 'Taxi Cab Confessions'.
Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.
Oh, look at that.  Cupids and hearts. Really shoving our faces in it this year.  You doin OK, bud?
No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.
So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that I've never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, 'Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?' And he looks at me and he says, 'Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket.' And I look back at him and I say, 'I feel the need!... The need for tweed.'
What is an office? Is it a group of people? Maybe. Is it an idea? Of course, yes. Is it a living organism? Exactly, yes. And any single cell organism has to have a spine, and that's me. But the spine is always controlled by a brain, and that is Jan. But the brain needs a heart, and that is me again. So ironic. You know what? The heart is smarter than the brain. But the brain is so effing hot.
Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing.  Congratulations. That is great!
Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.
I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it.
You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?
Hey, you. Big Jim. And Phyllis. Working hard, Phyllis?
This office is cursed.  [sighs]  And we need to do something about it.
I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important...
9:00 to 10:00, checked in with receptionist. Met with Jan, RE: log. Lost log. Found log.' '10:00 to 11:00, light salad, three points.' That's on the wrong page.
Just remember folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing.
You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!
OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant.
Well it's funny that you should ask, because it's really more than a company...
[holding up a binder] A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.[in a comedic voice] My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.
Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school.
No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we --[Dwight counts the raised hands] Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me?
OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week.
I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.
He did talk about a fire in the warehouse...  and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.
You didn't actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?
It is your problem.  That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off.  End of story.
Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke?  Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?
Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody.
Let's get back to the matter at hand.
Oh. Wow. 'Michael Scott Paper Company.' Okay. Very official. 'Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence.'
Okay, alright. Hey, you know what? I would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage.
No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers.
I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.
Toby actually gets alimony from his ex-wife because she makes more, so that's kind of embarrassing. Not that I'd mind, but it would never happen to me because I would make the marriage work. People seem to like him because they think he's one of us, but he's not. He's this weird loner who just tells people, 'Don't do this, don't do that. Hire this person for this reason.' I would complain about him, but who would I go to, to complain about Toby? Toby. Bias. And what does he do about that? Nothing. Because he's Toby. What kind of name is that? It's almost a girl's name. I think I've known more girls named Toby than guys. He just kind of makes my skin crawl a little bit. Toby is the devil. Toby's the devil.
Wow, Kevin, really? We're- [to Jan] Sorry. We're in the middle of a party. [to Kevin] Is this why you called me down here?
No, Jan.  I've never asked for a raise in 14 years.  This is long overdue.  I wanna do it today.
You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch. [in pirate voice] It's me own damn fault. Woman in every port.
[in the conference room leading a meeting] Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities.
No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working.  What are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops?
Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition.  Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition.  I'm so, so sorry.
I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it's not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesn't exist. Or that the sport doesn't exist? I should've known. Poopball?
[walks back in, on cell phone] What? Oh my God!  [everyone starts asking questions]  There has been a murder.  There's been a murder in Savannah. [runs back to his office]
Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?
Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.
Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go. [locks employees in conference room]
That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom.
Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don't worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha...  [bumps into something] ... ha ha ha.
Welcome, welcome! Cafe Disco. I am Michael Scott.
You know what's funny? Robin Williams. [sighs] When a cat gets stuck in a washing machine. City Slickers. Talking like Borat. You know what's not funny? Safety, or making fun of the person trying to talk about safety. [in Borat voice] Not nice. I must show people how dangerous office can be. High five... Now that's funny.
In nature, there is something called a food chain; it's where the shark eats a little shark. And the little shark eats a littler shark. And so on and so on. Until you get down to the single cell shark. So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.
Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies.
You're ruining it, already. They should not be given the choice.
It's good. This is good. We got it happening now. All right? Let's keep it rolling. Let's round it up.
Mmm mmm! Remember the 15-scooper we had last week? Wasn't that good? I was Scooperman, you were Scoopy-Doo. Remember what you said? You were laughing.
Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.
Istn't it?  Yeah, it's kind of... business/romantic.  So you're from Des Moines?
OK. Cool, you're on. [to Dwight] Don't screw this up.
Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon.
Oh, Oh, I take umbrage to that premise...ses. Umm, let me ask you this: How many people exist in the world? Over forty billion. What are they going to be writing on... rocks? Any one else? [points] Yep.
I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just... [waves Dwight away]
Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?
Okay, let me tell you a little story. When I was on vacation, I met a man named Bavon. And Bavon takes people parasailing. And you know what he said to me? He said that he loves going to work every day. How many of you can say that you love going to work every day like Bavon? [Dwight and Andy raises hand] No one.
Well, [points at himself] busier. Making the time.
Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.
No, I'm just poopin'.  You know how I be.
Party central! So, what can I do you for? [Guy leaves] All right.
Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you -
I thought that you might say that. [takes off his shoe; hums; takes out cash from shoe]
As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can... and did... twice. [speaking to camera] You saw the plaque, right? [to office] All right. We're all going to go around the room and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking.
Yes, that's a good point.  She has a good point.  Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law.  I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them.  So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could.  You know?  Sounds pretty good, right?
Home owner. About to join an exclusive club, Dwight. Maybe some day these people out here will know what that feels like. Maybe not. Who knows? Not my problem. [groans]
Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone.
Um, wanted: middle aged black man with sass.  Big butt, bigger heart. [knock on the door] I can't do this.
Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.
That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?
I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?
Games have the power to distract people from stressful situations.  Battleship got me through my parents' divorce.  Operation got me through my vasectomy, i.e., my operation.  I don't think I would have been able to endure my breakup with Holly had it not been for Toss Across.
Mm.  Me too.  Okay, let's get this started.
Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
Yeah, I gotta get in on this. [mocking Darryl] Hey, it's cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive! And I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!
[Kelly singing] Hey! Hey! Stop your mouth, please.
Ok, you know what?  I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.  [to warehouse guys]  Sorry, he is very lame.  [takes book from Toby] Um, let's see.  'Seasonal affective disorder!  A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter.'
No, it did not. And that is because at no time did you employ the use of humor. We'll find you a joke that not even you can ruin.
Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.
[walks out into the office] I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.
Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk.  [Tin Man voice] Oil can. Oil can.
I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.
So It's not true. Okay, well... ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just... racial profiling gossip.
You guys are the best for coming. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I understand.
[on phone] What's it... why are you crying?
What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. 'I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy'. Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.
Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though.
Just having a little 'guys in the workplace' thing.
So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?
Pump it up! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Huey Lewis' Heart of Rock and Roll plays] Pump up the volume. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen. [music stops] And welcome to C.R.I.M.E.-A.I.D. [clears throat] Crime Reduces Innocence Makes Everyone Angry I Declare. It is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no  Wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics. However, tonight, its victims, are standing together and standing strong in the form of song, cooking lessons, and hugs. Really Phyllis? You're auctioning a hug? Okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction! Take it away Bruce! [Huey Lewis' Heart of Rock and Roll plays]
Oh, party in the break room! Let's go, let's go! Thank God! Let's go to the break room.
Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship.  And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can.
What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her 'partner' in to work? [to Toby] Would that be crossing the line?
Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal?
They say that laughter is the best medicine so Stanley, you can throw away those pills. You are cured. Actually, you should... better hold onto  them pills, just in case.
Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. [under breath] And choke on it.
Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose.
Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What's going... What's going on?
No. [to hotel employee on phone] We're trying to look it up right now.
No, no, no, no, no-no, no no.  You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing.  Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her.
We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg!  Jim leave us.
Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme...
Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. You're funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date?
Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.
Let's gooooo! Let's go, let's go, let's go!
I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I don't think you need to worry. Because if you want to beat China you will. If you don't, that's fine. That my friend, is your victory. Y'know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China, and that may be the true, but what they don't tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation.
No. It's... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?
Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.
Let's follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesn't like Michael anymore. Hmmm.
Just drive faster. I want to get back.
Okay. Well...get ready, 'cause it's gonna get better.
Where's the baby?  I want to see the baby.  Oh!  Oh, Helene, hi.  Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this?  Congratulations on being a grandma.
Ok, you know what?  You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff.  Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?
This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?
[imitating Chris Tucker] Don't ever touch a black man's radio!  ...Chris Tucker.
Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'.
Did you hear about Angela? That's pretty weird.
Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene?
Well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people.
Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself.
And she is a woman.  She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman.  And you know what?  I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. [to camera]  Jan, I defend your honor.  [to Dwight]  Is that all?
No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela's boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously.
[sitting at Jim's desk]  Hey Jim.  I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.
[singing] You down with the Dundies? You're all my homies
OK, press conference in 45.  Dwight, make sure this place looks nice.
He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired.
Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?
All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store.
Well, they're good snacks. They're good food, good meals, good lunch. Roman noodles are good too. You still sleepin' in the car?
[off screen] Pam...you're missing things. [shakes off hand and starts writing in notebook]
Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much.
Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
Well the invitation says VIP's only.  Is this how you treat your VIP's, Ryan?  We're already in the city.  The main part with the buildings.  What am I supposed to do?  What do you want me to do tonight?  And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up!  Okay I'm going to throw up.  I'm throwing up.  You're making me throw up, Ryan.
[crashes into Jim and Pam's parked car] Oh, my god!
Good. Thank you, Phyllis. That wasn't so hard. All right, here we go. 'Office Depot is an annoying store. One day Creed went there to buy paper. And he ran into irritating Cylons.'
Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?
Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.
Did somebody say 'baby back ribs'?  Hmmm? Hmmmmm?
Guys, come on, I'm on a date. Let me do my thang.
Absolutely. Is this mine or is this Chili's?
...make much of out of it, Creed. Good luck to you. I don't know. It is a defective ax, my friend.
Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.
Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way.  Autumn was what I was going to say.  When the leaves change.  It's just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.
Look at that. Triple your investment by January.
All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!
Yes, I did, for you, princess.  Even though I only went number one. [quietly to Jim] I didn't really wash my hands.  Ohhh, what have we here?  This looks delicious. [picks up amuse-bouche tray]
Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.
[points at woman] What does that look like to you?
Thank you very much. You didn't have to say that.
Yep. Tell them how much you're gonna get if you win.
[feigning accent] Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl?
I put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter.  And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.
She was kind of tripping me up, cause she was, um, I was trying to get something going, when I was over her with the gun, and she like kept changing the story.
Gets to go home. [everyone starts to do push-ups] Ooh! I say 'dance,' they say 'how high?' Here we go. Oh, no. No, no, no. Butt to high. [steps on Angela] Disqualified!
Do you want that for little Jessica? No, you don't. And the answer is clear. Stop the bus. Okay?
I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism.
[on phone] It is disgusting.  I totally agree.  Well, we're going to recalling all of that paper.
No touching. Ah, I'm trying not to touch you.
Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.
How about July 4th weekend? [Reveals paper ticket]
That would be hot. I would pay to see that.
I will call you when it is time. [Jim and Dwight leave]
Are you still taking the antidepressants? 'Cause it was a good idea. 'Cause it'll help. It'll help, man.
Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me. [walks toward the door]
No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette [holds up barrette] We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did.
Daaah, let's just run away together.  Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would... be fine.  We'd have fun.
Holly broke up with A.J last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened... to me. To Holly, it's been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information? That's what I thought. But, you know what? Here I am using it.
Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!
[laughs] I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids...
I don't ask for much for Christmas, I really don't. It's not like I'm begging people to buy me diamonds and ...broach pendants. 'Oh buy me something expensive or I'm gonna kill myself.'  That's not - I don't care about that. All I want to be is Santa. And, you want to take that away from me?  Fine. Go ahead. But when you need my help because I am ruining everything, don't look at me.
Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up.
Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus' dad?
Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet.
I want to keep those so I can see what I sent.
I'm not, I'm not getting married. So... [laughs] Psych.
Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?
Well I'm looking at a photo, right now. And I'm telling 'ya, could be in Maxim.
I have been a loyal employee for a long time.
OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin... He's butchering it. Could you just let me... [As Chris Rock] Every time... Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass... [Bleep] I take care of my kid!
Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.
Hi, Jerry.  Michael Scott.  Well, this is slightly embarrassing. [laughs] Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday.  Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we're just going to need a much, much bigger check.
Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now.  And it doesn't matter how great a guy I am.  And that is all I needed; I'm good.  I can go home now.
I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket. [covers Meredith's face with his jacket] You are now sexy in your culture.
You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?
You know who I really think should go? Stanley.
Um, no, I just thought we'd wing it. That cool?
So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key.
Look at his face! Look at his face!
You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?
Those people will be ruined. [runs out back door]
Yeah.  In all climates.  It's going to be worldwide.  And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me.  That's where you come in.
Oh my God. You don't even know. She's single now.
What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm.
This is not a game, this is my life.  You are out of order, sir.
Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.
Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again. [notices Meredith hugging Kevin] Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day.
Pam-casso! Sorry I'm late, I had to race across town.
Not last - no. In like the last ten years.
There's something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.
I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over.
No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day in the office. Everybody gets dumped Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice? [Gabe nods] A little cover-up on your Adam's apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a transvestite. [Gabe looks awkward and Michael winks]
Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  Now I can't pay for your college.  But you don't have to go to class to be in class.  Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience.  And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop. [students perk up] Which is rendered useless without batteries, and I have one for each of you.
God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?
Woo, well, this brings us to Jan.  Truth or Dare?  Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh.
Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?
Nothing? Well I got a little somethin' somethin'. I don't know if I should say...
I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy.
You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car. [sighs] And it's not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesn't make any sense... God is dead.
You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good.
All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch?
I--- I---  Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that...
The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.
Can I have everyone's attention please?  Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who's supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question?  Do you all know what it's like to be disabled?  Oscar?
Oh, come on.  We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul.
Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this. At all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful. And you are fun. And you are smart. [Erin is smiling] And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will. [kisses her head] And you know what? You don't need a mom. Because you have my number, and you can call me anytime.
They wouldn't make it unless people liked it.
Happy Halloween, everyone! [notices Pam, in her cat costume] Oh... that's great!
All right. Mmhmm. [both start laughing and hug] Hey.
Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom, gay-friendly.
Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for.
[sweaty and chugging water from a bottle] It's so freakin' hot in there. Now I know what Bob Hope was going through when he performed in Saudi Arabia. Man! I got Dwight sucking the funny out of the room, but you do what you can do. [Music starts playing in the background] Here we go, he's early with the cue. Here we go.
No problem.  The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse.  From 2:30 to 3:15.  It is the only time that Bob was available.  Sort of a guy's night out.  A G-N-O if you will.  A Gah-No.  Actually, it's more of a guy's afternoon in.  A G-A-I.  A gay.  Not- not- it's uh, not gay, it's just a, it's a bridal shower for guys.  A guy shower.  An hour long shower with guys.
Well then... hey you know what then let's just talk.
Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him.
Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out.
All right! So, anybody else? No bad ideas. Everybody, let's keep 'em coming... oh, God.  Okay, Toby?
No, the baby doesn't ruin anything, Kevin, OK?  The baby multiplies the fun.  Let's just do what you were going to do.
[Laughing] Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.
No. [tries to hide piece of paper, but Pam grabs it]
It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.
I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then it'll suck.
You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so...
OK... Meredith, [hauntingly] Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.
I used to get offers in the mail for credit cards all the time.  They would say things like 'don't pay for six months' or 'you can transfer your account from another card'...
No he did not. I don't need his permission.
How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black?
No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that.
Waste? What does that even mean? Like garbage?
[as the power and lights come back on] My Bad. Space Heater and Fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet.
Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not superstitious, but... I'm... I am a little-stitious.
[running out of the building with Oscar, Andy, and Dwight] Oscar! Oscar! Come on!  There he is! There he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!  Scranton! Scranton! Scranton! Dunder Mifflin!
[Pam walks in and shows Michael a note that has a smiley face] Oh, no, no, no, I don't have time for this. Tell him I'm in a meeting. [Jan looks impressed]
You're thinking of the broad jump.  Would you try-- bungee jumping?
Fax, why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur?
Okay. You know what, let's just go to the dump, start looking - Ryan, c'mon, shotgun in my car -
[Creed is using the toaster as a mirror, and touching up his hair with a Sharpie and a comb] The one advantage to being older is that I know a few things about a few things, and I am young enough to not forget them.  And old enough to know the difference between the two.  I am old enough to take advantage of age discrimination laws, but young enough to date college girls.  But old enough to know better.  I'm at a perfect age.  I could die now.  But I won't, because I am young.
Wow. Oh, yummy. [David spreads marshmallow fluff on bread] You have got the life, my friend.
[singing] Can you hear me, they talk about us...
Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on!
That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client.
And that- I-I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, it's all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear?
I think Angela might be gay.  Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair?  Maybe!  Is that what this is about?
I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am...
Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut [closes box].
Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And, know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more person's breath away.
Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is.
Wow, graphs and charts, somebody's really been doing their homework.  Looks like USA Today.
It is six a.m. [DeAngelo yawns] and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their Dundie Nomination Certificates. Just like the Oscars!
Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss.
Oh, right. God, too bad. It's so good.
Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse.
Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I'm not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me?
Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today. [Dwight holds up passport.] Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.
Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.
I know. Ugh, that is so annoying. [makes fart noise] Brain fart. By the way, do you remember any funny interactions we may have had recently that I've forgotten about? Just, you know we  bumped into each and you said, 'Brr, brr.' And I went, 'Argh, Argh.' You know? Anything? [shakes her head 'no'] Well, if you think of something, let me know. 'Cause I like to know. 'Cause I'm going crazy.
[passes Isabel] Hey, good morning.  [to Dwight] It's about damn time.  I haven't gone to the bathroom in a day and a half.  [walks into hotel room]  Oh my God, Dwight.  This room is a pit.
Shut it. [answering phone] Hey, Pam, what's up? Yep, yech... no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes. [to others] Say hi to Pam!
Well we did talk about how handsome you are.
That is a serious offense. Very serious.  As is toying with a man's heart.
[mumbles in his sleep as Pam and Jim change the clocks in his office]
I learned a lot about women today.  And any man who says he totally understands women is a fool.  Because they are un-understandable.  Jan and I broke up. Why?  Because she didn't like one message I left on her voicemail?  But that is her peariagative.  I thought I understood women, but maybe, can't believe I'm gonna say this, maybe, women don't understand themselves.
This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.
No. We're only 10 minutes from the lake.
Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother won't be able to.
You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.
Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?
Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think.
[counting cash] Seventy, eighty, one, two three.  Eighty-three dollars.  Still a lotta money and I'm going to ... [moves money after seeing workmen walk by] ... I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it.  I will be taking Jim's clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest.  Let's see who winds up with the cash, shall we?
Well, I would definitely have sex with Ryan. 'Cause he is going to own his own business.
Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so...
No I won't! I'm not strong! And I'll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God!
Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour. [Cindy laughs and walks away]
A lot of people are really getting into Halloween this year! [puts head down over fake bomb made from cardboard, high pitched voice] Six seconds, MacGruber! [lifts head] Pam's got a lot of fun stuff planned! [puts head down, high pitched voice] Uh, two seconds MacGruber! [lifts head] Including a... costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a Ouija board... OHHH! BOOM! OHH EXPLOSION! [throws fake bomb, takes off sunglasses, points to camera] MACGRUBERRRR!
Yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please.
Hi. [Michael sees Toby] No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here?
I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just...
Meredith has an E-vite from Jim.  Barbeque at Jim's tonight.  Tonight?  Wonder where my e-vitation is.  Click on guest list.  Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed.  Must be... .[scrolls down list] No.
Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't.
Never.  About what?  A little-- what are you talking--
Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade 'A' gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why.
Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, 'Who is this smart little cookie?' Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.
[comes over to hug them both] My girls.  There they are. [Pam walks away]
It is the easy way out. You are not alone.
Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-
Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can't do that. We can't do this. Ohh.
Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think... that I don't even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which...
Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged.
Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product... the progidal... my son returns.
That is a great way to kill this party. Not on my watch. Let's, uh,... Let's rock. Let's rock some stuff here, okay? [playing badly] Okay... I'm hearing a little too much reverb. [feedback echoing] Can we down the reverb? All right. Follow my lead. [playing Smoke on the Water] Does you guys know that? Take the bass. Take the drums. What?
You're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay, if you did. It's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding. And you're nervous...
Ah, well it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke... your daughter Emily. How's she doing?
[while Jake is throwing things at Michael] They want how many spiral pads?
By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.
Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.
[on the tape] Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.
[groans] And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.
We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.
What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.
[Walks out of the Ladies' Restroom] Let's go. The men's room was disgusting.
No... no, this is just a stupid formality.
I, I put a mark on her arm. [Both are laughing] So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike!
Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage.
I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.
Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade?  It's not like gay... shame festival.
All right, our next award... ah, yes, this award goes to the most creative writing on the ladies' room wall, and the winner is... Who is it? Who wants to claim it? Shiny Dundie. Who wrote it? Great idea, Dwight.
We have a crisis.  Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock.  Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing...  unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like.  I've never been a fan.
Hey, Mister tally man, tally me banana, six hand, seven hand, eight hand, BRUNCH! [snickers] So delicious. Dinner, too. And every morning I would watch the sunrise and I would eat a mango. That is how I want to feel all the time. It's called island living. You know, how they say take a chill pill? In Jamaica, I took one. Guy on the beach sold it to me for $40. And after I finished vomiting, I was more relaxed than I ever have been. Lost six pounds, too. That's how I want every day to be.
We will?  I can't.  I don't have an idea in my head.
Ok, that's our street! That's our street! He's going down our street! [runs out of conference room.] Come on everybody! [all quickly follow]
Nothing.  Just hangin'.  Chillin'.  No agenda.  Would you consider hookin' me up with one of your friends?
Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. What's the problem?
Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!
Okay.  Pam, I'm coming down to get my present.
Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza.  Please, thank you.
[sings] ee... I was meant for you... buppity du bom bu.
I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.
50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know,  you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.
[on video in background] Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?
I think an investor's ski trip is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience.
OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody.  Anything new on YouTube?  Doesn't even need to be good.  Oh God, I can't think, need more Mullins.
You know what, here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he's just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He's invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It's not Terminator.
Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too!
Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you.
So, as friends, would you go with me on a camping trip?
That's... What do you mean, 'Michael'? That's not even my handwriting. [exits conference room] Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?!
Those are just things.  This is how I want it to feel.
Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?
Got it for Ryan.  Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out.  Figured...
Just want you to succeed Pammy.  You know what, we shouldn't even be talking about business today.
To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?
I've never framed a man before, have you?
Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast?
That is not the way I heard it.
Her passwords aren't going to be Dwight, Dwight. That's stupid. Okay.
You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said.
[in Michael's car] Okay, just throw out all the empties.
Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that.
[frazzled and out of breath] I wrote you a goodbye poem. It's really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?
A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.
I'm not gonna lock my door.  [door closes. Then clicks locked]
I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a bullet. We're gonna call them, we're gonna put them on speakerphone right now...
Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?
And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight? [howls and growls like a werewolf]
Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.
We should come up with a signal of some sort.
Everybody takes the subway in New York. It's fast, it's efficient, gets you there on time. It's a way to [turns and rushes back up stairs] Okay, there's a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.
Anything can happen at the Dundies! [DeAngelo laughs] They're like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!
Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?
Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn't score and I'm not sure who's actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o.
Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.
Why do you always do that? Whenever I'm getting married, you don't believe me.
[to Jim and Pam] How long have you known about the pregnancy?
Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?
Uh huh, uh huh. [under his breath] Power trip.
Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear 'Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la.' No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired.
All right girls break it up, you're being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse.
Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. [shakes head] Not... so, your desk is...
Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.
Thought that was you.  Hi.  Michael Scott.  This is Jan Levinson-Gould.
Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?
[hits Pam in the head with a piece of paper] Off the backboard!
We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.
Good work. I'm proud of you. [Pam and Oscar leave] Mother-
Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?
What do you guys think? [all start talking at the same time]
Um. Oh. [moves stove burner] Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?
OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr...
Oh. Bad boy. [to Ryan] Um... Ryan? [makes Donald Duck noise]
How 'bout a toast. Shall I? Here's to good friends.
I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.
[sitting on the roof of the office building] Well, I'm moving to Colorado to start my new life with Holly. Just up here, getting used to the altitude.
Man, was he fat. So, so... fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty.
Can you confirm that the straps are tight?
I don't know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy there's actually something going on here-
[whispering] It's Michael Scott.  [applause; Michael jumps through sign] Hold it up.  Conference room, five minutes.
Heart is.  That makes a lot more sense.  You think they'd help each other out like that at corporate? [Oscar shrugs] I think not!
Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.
Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.
I can't believe I pushed that... that guy's lazy ass around all day... until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That's... well... I got news for you, Albert. If that's your real name. The show's not over.
Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it's really sad because everybody thinks you're a loser...
[starts to cry] I don't understand why you keep picking on me.
You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret.
Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do.
This was a pretty disappointing day.  It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about.  But, you know, I'm not gonna cry over it.  I did that in the car on the way home.
In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions? [Oscar looks irritated and frustrated] Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?
Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. [everyone raises their hand]
Yeah, oh don't say bucks, it's not lady like. Here we go! [gets in backseat] Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night.
All right.  Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager.
Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we're going to take your clothes off.
It's nice to see you doing so well.
Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you.
When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her.
Oh, cool. Cool. And maybe you could attend tonight and then you could stay over at my house for the night. Awkward. That's... You know what. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone?
Because a lot of people think that models, even though they're very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It's set our industry back quite a bit.
And weirdly I'm a good dog person, right guys? [dogs go to him] See? They love me.
[clears throat] What's the difference between Meredith and Michael Jackson? Michael Jackson's surgery was unnecessary.
Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.
Yes, she is.  At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it's heyday.
No, you're supposed to say, 'Rock the house.'
Doctor David Friendly's Egg Yolk Diet.  It's, it's kind of unique.  It's just, my diet the last couple months has consisted mostly of eggs yolks and cottage cheese.  And, um, what you do, you don't just have the egg yolks, it's not like a Rocky thing.  You do like hard boiled eggs and I got one a those melon ballers [shot of Michael peeling boiled egg] and I, it's just like a little ice cream scoop, and I just scoop out the middle of the egg and just pop it in my mouth.  I don't even, I don't even use a plate anymore.  Uh, the first couple weeks I did, but you know what, boom, I keep a melon baller in my desk so if I have a hard boiled egg [Jenna breaks as Pam and laughs] I know, I know!  But you know what?  It's perfect.  I know it sounds ridiculous, it sounds ridiculous, but you know what?  Dr. David Friendly, he came up with this thing.  The guy, I think he was like four hundred pounds when he started, and he started with this... I, well, the melon baller was my idea.
Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the baler?
Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?
I've never met anyone who does that. You wash dogs? Very cool.
[driving] That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?
You think that's good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.
All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution:  Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.
It's uh... two and a half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone.
[walks up] Yes! Yes!  I have so much joy...  in my heart... right now.  How do I look?
I'm sorry.  I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant.
The wildcard is dinner at a nice restaurant.
[to Holly] Well that's a... pretty good reaction. [Holly nods] Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?
It's illegal. Can't do that.  Next best thing.
How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator.
Which one of these is coolest? What do you think? [classical piano playing] [violin playing]
Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.
You don't, you don't know me. You've just seen my penis. I can make a difference, remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this... GD 5k [gets up groaning, Jim tries to help] No, no!
Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there?
I have it on good authority that you said the following. [hands Andy a notecard]  Can you read that back to me?
No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal.  You know what I am talking about.  You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the...
It's Britney bitch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company.  [tries to parallel park, hits car.] Okay. Not gonna make this one. [drives away revealing plenty of space for the Cruiser]
[hears a taxi honking] Oh shoot! That's my cab.
I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos.
Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips...
Well, it has always been a lifelong dream.
I don't believe I have had the pleasure.
Aren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me.
[after talking to David, Jim looks dejected] I can't help but feel partially responsible.
I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. [on cell phone] Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late.
Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-
You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference.
Happy to do it.  Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.
No, no, no. No, that's a German woman named Urkel Grue.
