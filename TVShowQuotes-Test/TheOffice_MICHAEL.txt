Hup! [throws cheese puff to Pam who catches it in her mouth]
I am king of forwards. It's how I like to do business, everybody joking around. We're like 'Friends'. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer.
Uh-uh.  No, no, no.  Come on. Get up.  Let's do this.
Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.
Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?
Well, you don't have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.
Just one joke.  Ok.  Well, if it's just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke.  Umm... let's see... choo choo choo.
No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I don't hate it, I just don't like it at all. And it's terrible.
Hello, Stephanie. Ok, where is he? [looks into empty office]
I don't know, nothin', what's up with you?
Yes, that's a good point.  She has a good point.  Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law.  I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them.  So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could.  You know?  Sounds pretty good, right?
Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me.
Thank you. All right, when we get a call I'll come back and you'll do the smile.
Which one of these is coolest? What do you think? [classical piano playing] [violin playing]
Yep, right after you.  Apres-vous. [mouths to Pam] No calls.
No. Hey... I mean, although it's just for fun, you know we want... I was counting on you man.
Can we have a moment?  [whispering] Can I talk to you for a sec?  Lot of good stuff. And you look... you look fantastic.
[looking at the chair model's headstone] How did she die?
Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets...
You know Drew, why don't you go inside. Dwight come here. Where should we put this?
Luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup. You click on that first, then a whole new-Not, no, no, no! [Luke points laser at Oscar's forehead] Luke, come on. Come on. Not on Oscar's head. Alright. Luke, come on. Stop it!
Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould. [walking out of his office] Jan, hello.  I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah.
Okay! [Bob Vance and Michael in an all-out sprint, Michael grunting]
Hello, Dwight, I've been expecting your call. What do you want?
Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.
Yes, I am choosing my apprentice. Which is why I have modeled all my games after Survivor.
I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?
Oh, oooh his mistress.  No. I'm kidding.  No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.
Well you don't need two of you to do that.
Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.
...you just gots to get your freak on.
[singing] Can you hear me, they talk about us...
That's a shame.  A shame to waste these.  I want to buy them from you.
What you talking bout, Wallace? [imitating What you talking bout Willis]
[rolls down car window] Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They've been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.
Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.
We should look into that.  Or we just go for the loft.
[Gabe is still standing in front of Michael's desk] And you, why are you still here.
Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out.
Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be?
It was us? Really? I didn't, I didn't know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face.
Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me.
Ry-an.  You're here.  Whatcha got, whatcha got?  Alright, Panic Room, Maverick, Nell, Sommersby, The Accused.  Where's Little Man Tate?
Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I...
All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.
What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, 'Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?' Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.
[Jo Bennett enters with two humongous dogs, everyone stands to welcome her except Dwight] Why hello!
What? No Gabe is... Gabe is not the boss.
Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring.
Look at the ass. Check out the ass.
I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you.
I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!
Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and -
okay, that's uh, hard to keep track.  How many is that per hour?
Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.
What is happening? Oh, God, what is happening?
[on the phone] Uh-huh? Yeah. Well, you know, like in a fast food restaurant, just to be nice they hire somebody who can't even find their way to work? That is Dwight.
Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you.
Oh!  Eww... apricot.  Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or--
Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages.
OK, who's hungry [Kevin starts to put hot dog in mouth] No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest. [sighs at the table] For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set.
Phyllis and Bob: their celebrity couple name would be Phlob. You look at her... and she's kind of matronly today, but back in High School, I swear, her nickname was 'Easy Rider'. Now as for Bob... Bob Vance...
Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn't that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don't be stupid. Just take it back.
Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco! [Dwight hits Michael in ear] Hey! Come on, man. It's not even to 'Y'.
[flashback to Oscar's birthday, hiding in the break room] Happy Birthday!
No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK. [sniffing] You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan? [sighs]
We found something far better, their crown jewel.  Their industrial copier.
Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please?
Okay, let me tell you a little story. When I was on vacation, I met a man named Bavon. And Bavon takes people parasailing. And you know what he said to me? He said that he loves going to work every day. How many of you can say that you love going to work every day like Bavon? [Dwight and Andy raises hand] No one.
He was, but, uh... that desk was empty.  He'd come in and sit there sometimes.
Newsflash:  I've been here for fifteen years. Headline:  You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story!
Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
Do you? I don't think you do. Devon was one of my best buddies. And now he hates me.
Mmm! Fruit is so much better when it's dried. I've already eaten, like, 30 apricots.
Yeah, mon. Me just got back to the office.
Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.
No, I feel it's my responsibility as your boss slash friend.
Hey, there he is! Secret weapon! All right, guys, come on, let's bring it in! Here we go!  OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right? We are all on the same team here, the Dunder Mifflin team. Of course, if you beat us, you're fired. That's a joke.  OK, let's do it.
He is also in an interracial relationship, so, you know, if you have any problems, you can always call him.
No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace. [Michael pulls out his cell phone] I will call David Wallace.
Wikipedia... is the best thing ever.  Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.
Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you...[phone rings] What do you...
Hey! I know what'll impress everybody, I'll start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.
Yeah!  They were the most fun.  We always invited them.
All right, Okay, okay, you're getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE.
Business is like a jungle.  And I... am like a tiger.  And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick.  Does the tiger fire the monkey?  Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch?  [smiling] Pun.  There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head.  We don't have the technology.
[trying not to cry] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority.
So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two.
Pac-man [imitating the noises of the video game Pac-man eating dots]
This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go.  [pick up phone] Hank, could you come up here please?  Hank is our security guard--
[speaking at a staff meeting] First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don't have a pet, please don't feel like -
What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?
Yes!  We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby.
Well, you don't even have anyone to go home to, Toby.
What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.
Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on.
It is moving day.  I have spent the last month here at Dwight's lovely farm, taking a little bit of a vacation, clearing my head after Jan and I, um [Dwight puts his fingers to his head and makes a shooting noise] ssp... No, I did not kill her.  We were just at different places in our lives.  No, I thought I'd be the bigger man and allow her to stay at the condo.  She has since moved on; she is staying with her sister in Scottsdale.  Fresh outlook, and it's all good.
Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts.
Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only.
Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour.
...who works at our hotel.  You look, how do you say, radiant tonight.
Was this year's Dundies a success? Well, let's see, I made Pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost.
It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it.
And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions.
Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had sex with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didn't consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful.
Oh my God. You don't even know. She's single now.
Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.
Shh shh shh... don't look down, look straight up. Come on please!
Hello! They took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride! [awkwardly climbs out of his car]
Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?
You can do the old way or whatever you think would work. [phone rings]
I got it!  I got it!  Everybody it's go time!  At your stations.  Stanley, man the phones.  Meredith, please, get bottled water.  Erin, call an ambulance, please!
Man, he is late. I'm gonna call him. Do you mind? I'm sorry. [calls Deangelo, Deangelo's phone vibrates]
I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.
And, hey, don't embarrass me when we go to Niagara.
How much time do you think you'll need?
The guys at the papermill--- No no no!
No, Computron, actually I think Cooper's is the best. You're gonna love it.
This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis' father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, aren't you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can't believe I'm actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Let's do it.
You know what, we don't have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps.
Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your penis. [everyone is shocked] [exhales]I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.
I want you to rub butter on my foot.
[accent] Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that's a misdirection.  We still don't know who the murderer is.  [everyone leaves] Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here.  I can't do this myself.  Voodoo Mama Juju... what am I gonna do?
We're doing this because of you.  So why don't you just go stand somewhere else.  [to Ryan] Hey.  Hey.  You shaved?
It's like, a girl says she'll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.
Kind of, yeah. Over the shirt, my elbow, but...
Yep, I did.  I did.  But I think... you should do it.
[sees Pam walking towards the door of the office] Um, Pam.
Oh, you are such mench my friend. [They stand up and do fist bump and explosion]
I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.
[into recorder] Boner Bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera.
Too many times. It's all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.
Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let's move that up. Here we go.
[In Horshack voice from 'Welcome Back, Kotter'] Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo, Mr. Cart-air, Mr. Cart-air.
I need you to do something for me.
Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt.
[Michael dismisses note, Ryan and Pam point to notepad] Dwight, are you talking about us?
How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator.
You know, when I hired Kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse.
Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again.
[to Christian] I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say?   They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?
OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week.
...trid Levinson.  Hi!  Astrid, this is everybody, look.  This is your family.  You're going to know them for the rest of your life.
No, I am, it's all about the personality, Jim.
Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot.
I am the guy who roused that crowd.
Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you.
Okay, show of hands.  Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any?  [Stanley raises his hand]  Who else?  Come on!  People, I know models!
Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me, that's who you're worried about?  You're... you're worried about the cop's time?  You think I framed you, and you're worried about the taxpayer?  Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.
Everybody! Everybody! Listen up, I need your ideas, now! Ideas please, right now! Go! Go! Come on!
I will call you when it is time. [Jim and Dwight leave]
[sighs] What am I gong to do?  Uh... [chuckles].
And we are going to straighten this out.
Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have! [laughs] Nice, huh?
Hey, uh, can I help you out in here?
I hate shushing. You know, that's the thing! What the... ok... what is our beef as human men.
[annoyed] All right.  Dwight.  Just push and breathe.
We will find another way, we'll ask power-point.
Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. [under breath] And choke on it.
Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero.
Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.
You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing.
I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus.
No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela's boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously.
Hello, hello.  Hey!  Your face is almost back to normal.
Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.
Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up.
Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?
They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say that's crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad.
Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it.
Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.
Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That's it. And the caption would read:
We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg!  Jim leave us.
We're very excited too, aren't we guys? Right?
Do you agree about what? [laughs] Wow. You're  lucky you're so darn cute.
See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.
I don't have an in case. Do you have an in case?
Try 'profits'.  No! Try 'Michael Scott'.  'Michael' 'boss' and 'funny'. [Sadiq (IT guy) types; result pops up] Oh my God, wow!  [chuckles]  E-mail from Stanley. Stanley,  Terribly nice guy.  [reads e-mail]  'Sorry I didn't write back sooner; I can't go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late.'  Well, Stanley's an ass.  Not one of our harder workers.
Okay.  I promise.  [Pam starts to walk away] For the record your mom came on to me. [Pam turns around and slaps him; he gasps]
You can't see. You can't see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win. [Michael is using his head guard to hit Dwight] Eight points. Nine points. [Begins to hock a loogie]
Oh, there's Gill.  Oscar's roommate.  I wonder if he knows?
After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong.
Hello everyone!  As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis' wedding.  [Applause] So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did.  And Karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don't already have one.  This may be Phyllis' only wedding ever.  It is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins.  So I am instituting prima nocta.
Just having a little 'guys in the workplace' thing.
She was cute.  You know?  She was hot.  She was very hot.  She made love like a tiger.
I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even... what's the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?
You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,
Don't-all right. Well, ok, you've just committed a felony.
No. It's ok. Watch it. He can't fire all of you.
Did you know that in Morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time?  In Japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment.  In Italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom.  This is considered to be polite.
Hey, Stanley, is that jacket make of up-dog?
Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.
Come on, let's go back to the party.
Oh, here we go, here we go. Bogy at 3 o'clock. Hi.
Oh shoot! [gets to his car turns around]
I just had the best, most romantic week of my life in Sandals, Jamaica. Went with a lady, and we laid on the beach and drank fruity drinks for free, because it was all-inclusive. And then I flew back to Scranton, and then they lost one of my bags.
Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton. [to Tony] All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.
Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I'm not even going to dance one song.
Pam, can you come in here, please?  Have a seat.  [clears throat] Well, there's no easy way of saying this.  So I think I will just...drag it out.  Since the dawn of time there has been--
All right. All right, this is it. By the time I get back to our floor, I will have decided. [elevator bell dings] Wow, that's  a fast elevator.
Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David.
Oh, yuck!  TMI!  How was it?  I don't want to know.  Tell me later.  Let's go!  Let's go!  Hospital!
Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah.
Ok, good good, so we'll just all go down there together at lunch.
How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee? [looks at all the employees, most of whom raise their hands] And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? [employees mumble 'merely listen to and forgotten...' ] That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering... [sighs] Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?
Oh, right. God, too bad. It's so good.
You ready to give me my discount now?
I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello?
Mm-hm.  That is so cool how you have my name at the top.
And I was about to take her bra off...
Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, we're going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls.
She's dead? [Dwight makes knife slitting noise] She's so young.
[staring at birthday card] Meredith, Meredith... Meri... Mary had a little lamb. Mary... Meredith had a little lamb. Don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor.
You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?
[ccming to] Oh my God, how long was I out?  [Michael looks over where Blood Girl was and sees Hank]
Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.
A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.
God, when he needed help on Earth, who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son.
This... You know this is a scale of one to ten?
Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought.
Oh... okay. [looks back at Andy and Oscar] Doesn't matter, because I am going to take a nap.  I think I am going to use my complimentary blindfold.  I will don it... and oh! Look at that.  I can't see because I am in a-- [cart crashes into Michael's leg] GAH!
So I'm back.  And I am never, ever going to leave.  I am going nowhere.  This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones.
I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight. [hangs up] Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did I...and the only reason I got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in.
Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through? [Pam pushes a button the phone] Hi buddy.
I never recommended you because I didn't want to lose you and I didn't want to lose Pam, [starts to choke up] and now I don't wanna lose the baby.
Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so...
Okay.  We are off.  Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers.
Listen, why don't we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability.
[shying away] Look, [sighs] It's a pimple Phyllis. Avrile Lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive.
You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going?
[on the phone] What can we do to help you out? You know what? I have a discount. Today and today only, on lightweight copier paper.
Don't! Nope! Please, don't want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.
And now... to someone who quietly goes about their job, but always seems to land the biggest accounts...
We have a little song prepared for you.
Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse.
[voice breaking] Yeah, well, at least he was married.
[Phyllis scores] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! In, your, face! Angela, what's the score?
[looking at nothing] Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.
You know let me give you some money for this.
No, that was- I'm just getting into the first act.
Well, hello to you, too.  Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's.
My generation's all about hard work and accomplishment.  Like... the moon landing.  Or Vietnam.  Rolling Stones.  Greatest band ever.
Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch.
Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me.
No! Gosh! Dwight. [Dwight tries to hit Michael with his shoe again] Stop it, stop it! Stop it.
Yeah, I'm hungry, but I'm not going to make a pig out of myself.
Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.
Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.
Well we  should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright. [Pam tosses list out car window] Okay...
Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.
I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess.
Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend.
[singing along to tune on video] A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing...
Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!
Hey.  I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in.
[Darryl approaches as students throw basketballs] A little over the top, don't you think?
Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product... the progidal... my son returns.
I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, 'I wanna go to Mount Pocono,' you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.
All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch?
Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn't he say that?
[as Mikanos] I like the musical 'Grease', or as we call it, 'home'.
Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.
Oh, oh, oh!  Contraption!  She's contrapting!  Okay, you know what?  I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why.  I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania.  I gassed up the car...
Okay, well, I really think that... [dial tone beeping]
Just wanted to talk to you about  Jim Halpert.  I understand that he did not receive the promotion.  And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.
That's... That's. Well, don't put words in my mouth.
There you are.  I don't think we have finished with my Inbox.
Oh, shoot! Okay. All right. All right. [throws up hands] Pull it over. Here we go.
We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.
No, no, no, no. I don't want to chip my mug. Please get that off the floor. [sets mug on the edge of Michael's desk]
[in the background] How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don't know either.
Believe me its nothing.  I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched.
Oh no no no.. It's gonna work, it'll be fine.
Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um...
Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan.  [scattered applause] And how about casual Friday again, huh?  Reinstituting casual Friday?  You all look great.  What I want to do right now is try something a little different.  I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting.  I want you guys to run it.  I want you to say whatever you want,  take it away.  Your meeting.
So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs.
I'm going to have to do this Sopranos-style. Just whack him. Guys, could you take the freight elevator, please?
Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn?  I thought they were all sold out.
OK.  Oh, wait a second, wait a second, that's hers.   This is hers, she left her glove.  I need her name if I'm gonna return her glove.
Well, he was getting a lot of applause, and I just didn't think it was indicative of how people were really feeling.
Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'...
Well, they're good snacks. They're good food, good meals, good lunch. Roman noodles are good too. You still sleepin' in the car?
I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. [whispers] Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.
How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything.
[in video] To Oscar Martinez it's the 'Show Me the Money' award! Yeah!
My respect. [everyone returns to work] Okay, I'll make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups -
Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.  So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.
And the same thing goes for quarterly reports.  They are unreadable.  They're just numbers and boring and blech.  So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar? [everyone groans] Doesn't have to be a racecar.  Use your imagination.
The Electric City. Lazy Scranton, the Electric City. They call it that 'cause of the electricity. The city's laid out from East to West and our public parks are libraries are truly the best. Call poison control if you're bitten by a spider.
So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.
I am not going to discuss anything outside of Dunder Mifflin business, period.' Okay. Now, why would Jan say she only wants to talk business and then make it clear that she is on her period? God, I don't understand women. How about a clear signal, right? Is that too much to ask?
Yes, thank you. I know where to sign.
Well, that's a relief. Santa's gonna take some much-needed free time. Alright. Good!
Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you
I don't even know how to say this, but Cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. And that's not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out.
I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.
Hello, is this R. Gould? Hi there. My name is Michael Scott, I work at Dunder Mifflin. I believe I work with your wife, ex-wife, Jan. Yeah, that's right, yes. Um... I was wondering if I could ask a personal question about her. Mmm-hmm. Okay, well, could I ask anyway? Uh-huh. Well, I'm just gonna ask. When you guys were dating was she sort of easy to get and then really hard to get?
Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled!  Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let's get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.
Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No.  No.  This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this.
Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head.
That sounds good. [both smile] Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go.
Yeah, well I wasn't very hard to find.
Jim, you're in charge of the vacation schedule now.
Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.
Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.
Who's that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep.
I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. I'd prefer it if they died, 'cause it's not right.
Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?
Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I'll take her to lunch.
Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my penis... I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah... weird. I think that was ... I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F. Alf, you know, I might have actually been probed by Alf. You might think he's a puppet. You never see the lower half. But there is a lower half.
I'm trying to think of what we could sell.
Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can't do that. We can't do this. Ohh.
I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio?
Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting. [rips pages out of book] You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold. [gives book back] I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.
You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers.  And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.
Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.
You shouldn't have taken it.  Bad management!  Good thing I'm baaaaaack.  [laughs] Ryan, coffee.
Just seems awfully mean.  But sometimes the ends justify the mean.
What is it?  No, just tell me what it is.
What do we know about him? He's an accountant.
Three hours, wow.  Have fun.  [Dwight walks away staring through the blinds at Michael]
[enters office, somersaults onto couch, kicks over painting and lamp] Parkour!
We should have your contract done by Thursday.
Huh- [pauses] Does she ever talk about me? [voice cracking]
Uh, [reading the inside of his jacket] MISSterious.  And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery.
I've really learned from the greats. The great improvisers, Drew Carey, Ryan Stiles, uh, the Brady guy not so much. He's more the signing, Wayne Brady. Um, Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] 'Hi. I'm Mork from Ork.' Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo. [as Robin Williams] 'That's Good morning, Vietnam!' Well, hello to you. You know it would be... God. And you know what, sometimes when I'm watching somebody like um, like Jay Leno. He'll be half way through his step [snaps his fingers] And I will already be laughing at the punch line. He hasn't even gotten to it. He doesn't even know what it is it. So it's fun, you know it's fun having a mind that works like that. That is just a few steps ahead of... comedically ahead of like what's going on. Like I'll watch T.V. and I'll be watching a show and I will think, oh, I know someone's gonna walk in here right now and say something funny. And then they do. Or, um, I know they'll be like oh boy that person deserved to be slammed down. There's going to be some sort of insult. And there is. You know, there's like, 'Oh you're... God your butt is fat.' And I knew it. I know it's like I knew they were going to say that. I knew they were gonna go there. Don't go there. Um, but other... You know it's like uh, you know Leno, um and Letterman, Carson, you know. Need I say more? No.
Well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada.
Good.  These are some things that I would like to have happen.
Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?
That's how devoted I am to this job.
[in car, Michael driving] Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.
Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim?
Come on. What's your wife's name? Where did you work before you came here?
Oh, you know what, you have a siphon? I think I'm gonna run out of gas.
[driving in car; returns to office; grabs ice cream out of freezer] How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud. [beeping; cut to Donna who is waiting in the parking lot of the motel] Like a grownup.[Donna receives text from phone] That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And I'm a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision. [Donna has disappointed look; cut back to Michael in his office opening ice cream] At the end of the day, we have to do what's right. And it was either living with myself or... being happy. And I picked... the... former.
No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles.
There are ten rules of business that you need to learn.  Number one: You need to play to win. But... you also have to win to play.
Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go. [Kevin sits on his lap. It's a struggle] Oh my God.
Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?
Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles... Damn it. Okay, sorry. Don't laugh; please don't laugh this time Dwight. You're... it's, it's bugging me. Let me give myself a countdown, ready? Three, two, one.
Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then...
[pulls a brand new mug out of his desk door] That won't be necessary.
Yeah. I would like to see us erase 100 years of racism in an hour.
That is a great way to kill this party. Not on my watch. Let's, uh,... Let's rock. Let's rock some stuff here, okay? [playing badly] Okay... I'm hearing a little too much reverb. [feedback echoing] Can we down the reverb? All right. Follow my lead. [playing Smoke on the Water] Does you guys know that? Take the bass. Take the drums. What?
Okay. [Jan hangs up. Toby opens the office door.]
So the kid's making the noise to pick it up.
No, no Dwight. He's just being stupid. [the office laughs]
It's going very well.  People are mixing, a lot of hope.  Cause that's what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed. [Michael suddenly turns to look at the open entrance door] Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in.  Um, so [looking at his watch] it's not too late.
This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.
Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by [in an authoritative voice] Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace. [in normal voice] He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad.
Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That's it.
Because he's mean.  He's, he's like a really mean-spirited guy.  He talks about how gay Oscar is...
It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasn't.
Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?
[Michael is singing to the tune of 'Tiny Dancer' by Elton John] 'You have won a tiny Dundie.'
[talking to an attractive woman] Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up. I ball the entire time. I can not watch Pixar.
I guess this could be the one, huh?
Wha - that's, I hate her.  Wha - God!  Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha - OK, all right, fine.
You're welcome. Whoa! [leans back] Almost fell. [they both laugh]
[reading] 'This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer.' [flips to another paper] 'Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can.'  Gah. 'This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone.'
What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car.
Alright, relax. We can do it. We just did it. So we can do this again. Erin, scissor me please. [Erin tosses open scissors across Jim and Pam]
Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?
This isn't about me, and that is debatable.  And I have a personality, where as you...  Yes, Andy?
Everybody, may I have your attention please?  It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job.  I know, I know, I know.  'Michael, what are you thinking?  You were a shoe in.'  Well, got down there.  I nailed the interview.  And the strangest thing happened.  Why is my office black?
I can't get a stripper here.  Sexual Harassment.
I have my per diem. [holds up money] I already know what I am going to spend this on.  I am going to buy a sweater.
All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks.
Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things.  And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.
You. Bitch. God! You're very helpful aren't you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?
You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.
Here's a question for you. I have a convertible. Is it safe that park that in my driveway. [Man steps back inside his house and shuts the front door] All right. See you soon. Good guy. Um, cool.
Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.
Ok, everybody listen up.  If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.
Is there something that you would like to say to me?
Yes, that too, but I mean with the audio. Great work.
No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy.  What, what happened?  Did he call?
[holding up the catalog] Have you ever seen this woman?
I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.
[whispers] The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame.
Um, I am sort of a master of distraction.  When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class.  Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies?  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  [Michael covers his mouth and makes fart noises.]
Okay, good-bye.  Wait!  Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?  Your best one?  [Karen hangs up]
I am very happy right now. Thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation. When you have somebody's attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say, [Michael is seen whispering to Jim, then Pam] that is a great feeling, and I experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention.
If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody.
Negotiations are all about controlling things.  About being in the driver's seat.  And make one tiny mistake, you're dead.  I made one tiny mistake.  I wore woman's clothes.
You know, I don't know if I trust Jan's judgment. She...
[Laughing] Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.
Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great!
Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals.
[coming out from his office] Hello, may I help you?
What's up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we'll do it on my dime.
What difference does it make whether your here?
I'm trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis' wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes.  Which won't be hard, because it's going to be awesome.  A lot better than hers, that's for sure.  It'll probably be on a boat.
Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing.
Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?
[in Fat Albert voice] Fat Halpert. [in normal voice] Jim Halpert.
I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?
Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd come by, see...
I know.  I know.  It is beautiful.  No.  Thank you.  Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons?  You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up.  I think you need to get the lead out.  Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here.  We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower.  Well you know what, where's my golden shower, Phyllis?
NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO!
Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.
I didn't sign up for this. You guys are young, that's great. You want to give back to society. I've done that. I need to take.
Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don't think he is a snappy dresser.
I'm moving out to the burbs... actually, I'm moving further than the burbs, I'm moving to Colorado.
[embracing Oscar]You know what, I'm going to raise the stakes.  I want you to watch this.  And I want you to burn this into your brains.  Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come.  Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this.  [awkwardly kissing Oscar]  I did it.  See.  I'm still here.  We're all still here. [everyone claps]
Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher.
Oh hi. I'm sorry, just a sec. [whispers] Erin, you're supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?
Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it's really sad because everybody thinks you're a loser...
That mush have been a surprise when... at the gas station you proposed.
Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?
A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin.
Check it out.  Don't be a wuss, just get... no, I'm not holding your coffee.
Sales is and could be very, very cool.  If you like paper, and you love to laugh, this is the place for you.
I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.
This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it's cooler.
I'm tying a knot in the stem with my tongue.
Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, you're the face of this company.
I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine.
You're right. And I hope that we can still be friends.
OK, Ryan.  You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?
Because you're pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very...
Hey! [walks up to Oscar and Darryl tossing basketballs, grabs Oscar's ball] Game over. [kicks the ball up to the gymnasium ceiling]
Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.
[cradling the car seat awkwardly] All right, OK.
You know who used to sit at that desk?
[Kelly eating in the break room] Hey, is that healthy food?
Yeah, that Gould is a real interesting guy, a gem. I can see why he and Jan are no longer together. If my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship, he was verbally abusive, he was curt. He was... He had an inability to communicate, shall I say? He was emotionally unavailable. I don't know how she dealt with that as long as she did.
I'll take care of that for you. [crumples receipt and throws it in trash] Thanks.
[quietly groans] Okay, you know what? Just do your best buddy! Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education. And, I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So that's why I made you this. [takes a sack tied in the upper middle making a crude head, with a face drawn on, obviously the product of poor craftsmanship, Oscar pretends to like it]
[pointing to group of young adults laughing] Look at that. Look at that. That's fun. We need to do stuff together outside of work. Let's go help Africa. Let's go build an airport. We'll start small. We'll have a car wash. We'll send some cheerleaders to regionals.
[in line to fill up water bottle behind Kevin and Toby] Really? You don't have enough water in there? Your stomach?
That's a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.
Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus' dad?
Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so...
Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me.  You two were the only ones with the stones to follow.
No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette [holds up barrette] We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did.
Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all.
Jan got fired.  And I realized that I could not work for a company that would fire my girlfriend.   But more than that, I realized that... I couldn't take a job that would take me away from this place.  This is where I belong.  This is... my home.  And home is where the hardest.
Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may.
OK. Do you want me to repeat that?
She's gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I don't want to take any more of your time, I know you're a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider.
Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.
Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2?
I'm improvising, so just try to keep up. [phone rings]
[sees Holly and Todd shaking hands in the conference room] Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldn't be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.
Whispering and tickling have their place in business.
Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night?
It had to be done, it had to be done.
Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair.
I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.
Ok, see you later.  Nice job, Bill.  Not.
No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.
I fell off the toilet.  I'm caught between the toilet and the wall.
[clears throat] No, hey, hey , hey. You know what I just wanted to remind you about the game today. One 'o clock. Big game, big game.
Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.
Because, that is the way these things are done.  In... films. [Darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to Michael] No, slide--- slide it, yes.
Oh, look at that.  Cupids and hearts. Really shoving our faces in it this year.  You doin OK, bud?
Can't wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now.  Come on.  Come on.
[to Dwight] Mmm-kay.  I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.
Yeah, I gotta get in on this. [mocking Darryl] Hey, it's cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive! And I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!
Okay Pam, I have another little project for you.
Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin.  And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place.
That's my line! That's my line, That's... I always say that at weddings. So I'll just think of something else to say. I... [band starts playing]
Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride? [Meredith drops her top. Michael takes a picture] All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?
How many of you know the meaning of the Jamaican term, Hakuna Matata?
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.
Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?
Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly.
[walks over to Erin's desk] Hi, Erin. Happy Secretary's Day.
Oh do not raise your voice to me!
No no no no no no no. [accent] I'm going to skip forward to a relevant clue.  Here we go.
We're, uh, we're doing okay.  A couple weeks in and, um, we're having fun.  Uh, yep.  We have 20-- of those.
Have you ever heard of Doctor David Friendly?
[as Mikanos] Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on.
So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?
When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another.
Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.
We'll still get to use the little cups, though, right?
Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight.
Wait a second. [removes condom from wallet, throws it to Jim] I don't want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.
My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it. [sighs] ... How much?
You're gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I can't handle it. So let's just...let's...
He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse? [Elizabeth walks up in nurse's outfit] This is the reason we're here.
New York real estate.  I started by looking for a brownstone, like the Huxtables had, [shakes head] but instead I found this very, very, nice place in Jamaica, Queens, mon.  It is on the last stop of the subway, which is wonderful, because if I fall asleep, I still end up at home.  It is a suh-weeeet one bedroom.  I have a roommate, uh, Vijay Chokalingham, he's a sophomore at Queens College.  He actually works in the Indian restaurant right below the apartment, so... free food, and the place always smells like curry.  So, win/win.
And... and the love of my life is dating somebody else.
[Ten days later] Well, it's been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!
No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. [points to her picture on the wall] Or the funny things that they can do, like 'where's the Beef?' [points to another picture on wall] [Jim raises his hand] Yeah.
You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.
Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party.
This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now.
Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I've always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation.
You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real. [blindfolds eyes with tie] OK.
Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates.
Right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?
Yeah, well, Phyllis, nobody... really wants a hug, so.
Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?
[sighs] Ok, so I'm the guy at the station.
The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.
Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year's.
I had a great idea until you ruined it.
You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don't break the branches, Dwight.
Good.  Would you care to bang it out over lunch?
No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?
These are not my shoes. This is just like that show 'Taxi Cab Confessions'.
[exhales] How are you guys doing?  Need anything?
That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you.
Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up.
[to own camcorder] Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about [looks at watch] 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. [cuts pants with knife] OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here...
I'll call her back. [talks softy, to himself] Wish I could fire Sherri.
I'm not usually the butt of the joke. I'm usually the face of the joke. I wish Jim had fallen into that pond and he'd have to put on my suit and it'd be too short and he'd look... Damn it! He'd still look good.
I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..
What's your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason?
Being the boss is also about image.  I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. 'Outside Hire.'
I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'Fundle Bundle.' Okay? Without further ado, Ryan?
Actually, I'm a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a... celestine prophesy, and keep the next Bon Jovi from ever picking up a piano.
What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I'm getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good.
Smart as a whip! Yes! [holds up hot dog packages] These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.
No, no, no, no. You know what, I better hold off. I wanna make sure I don't dial Carol before I get drunk.
Can everyone please shut up, please! So you don't miss it.
Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded.
All right, OK. [to Andy] Sorry.  Sorry.  Here we go.  Here we go!
That's great. Thank you for coming in. [starts ushering him out] Robert Dunder everybody. [clapping] Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?
Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are.
[hangs up phone and walks back into conference room] Pamela Morgan Beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now.
I am not budging on the hat issue.
Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call.
Okay, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for Cat's Cradles. Burned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets.
Hey Jim, Jim. Come here. [holds up photo] Do you know who that is?
[to Kevin] Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up?
[facing the whole office] Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down.
You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that.
Yep, not as good as gold. [national anthem plays] Why are you playing the national anthem?
Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you don't. Not even Sabre owns this place. It's a rental. I'm kind of sick of the attitude around here. I'm sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim... I think I am not going to give these to you. [Angela, Kevin and Oscar applaud]
[extended Lazy Scranton video] Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon. Called my man, Dwight, just to see what was shakin'.
I learned a while back that if I don't text 911 people will not return my calls.   Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened.
Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that.
[Taps on the glass in his office to get Ryan's attention] Pick up.
I'm kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, it's just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room.
Please, Kevin.  You're fired.  [Kevin looks at Jim; Jim shakes his head]  Sorry, sorry.  Work with a bunch of idiots.  Shall we go?
Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa.
So I wanted to give you that. [hands him the envelope] It's a letter of recommendation. [Dwight looks eager. Michael nods to him and walks away]
This [picks up racquet] Why would somebody throw that out?
I uh... I actually don't know why I brought that because It's kind of priceless.
Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?
Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.
You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.
[in parking lot, blocking path of Stanley's car] Stop. Hold up, hold up, hold up! No, no, no. Time to stop being polite and get real. [Stanley honks horn repeatedly] Stanley, are you having an affair?
I'm Robert Mifflin. [pause to see audience's response] Ah, okay. [both run back to chairs]
I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.
...make much of out of it, Creed. Good luck to you. I don't know. It is a defective ax, my friend.
Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret?
My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right?
You know, I don't care what he did to me.  He's mean to other people, that's what gets me.  He's just...
Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello.
Ohh.  It was a weird day.  I accidentally cross-dressed.  And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money.  And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby.  And then, your assistant, is all young and hot.  And I---
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very conservative. So, mum's the word.
Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological.
Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.
Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?
[going up escalator in the hotel] This is nice.  This is nice.  Move in here.  Very sweet... ah.
I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist.
Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back.
Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone [starts running, Dwight follows]
I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.
No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!
I will call him later with that message.
You know what they say, keep your friends close. [pointing to office sign where 'Dunder Mifflin' is listed right above 'Michael Scott Pap']
Just... I want you to think about it, I'm starting my own company.
Jim it's okay. You can t... [Jim looks at Pam and shakes his head, Pam looks at him and gestures for Jim to go up and tell his story] This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. [Jim shakes his head no] It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. [Jim stands up] Oh, he's doing it, okay. [Jim looks at Pam] It's okay. [Jim pretends to try, looking teary eyed, shakes his head no, mouths 'I can't' and sits back down. Pam is amazed.] Oh. Okay, are you sure? [Jim shakes his head. Kevin pats his shoulder] That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. [Pam nods in admiration at Jim] Okay, well.
Hey, girls. What's happening? Startinng to blend? Well, before long, you guys keep hanging out, you guys you are gonna share the same menstrual cycle.
All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!
But then she goes on to say 'that will be our only topic of discussion'.  That doesn't mean anything, those are just words.
Someone complained that the men's room is 'whites only'. Stanley, you know that's not true.
Yeah! That's good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Let's do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, 'So Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?'
You know what can't fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everything's running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley.
You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?
Okay. You know what, it wasn't just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.
I do not understand what you spend your money on.
OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half.  I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.
Give me some. [Michael and Darryl perform simultaneous hand gesture]
Let's get back to the matter at hand.
It's not amazing... at all.  It's sort of weird that I went and did that.  And now your wish won't come true, so that blows.
I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.
Good, let's check that out. [looks at preview screen] Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.
Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesn't it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen. [starts round of applause] He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work.
Yes, she is.  At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it's heyday.
Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them.
Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here.  They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter.  They are treated like human beings. [sighs]
It's ok. We're having fun. It's not actually the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing. [Jim signals for making to stop] No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse. [Michael begins to lose his cool] Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'Who are your 5 friends?' and I'm, like, 'Uh... ' I didn't even know I couldn't even think. [realizing he's going downhill] Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don't even have Jan's cell phone number and I hate her! She won't give it to me. I was like, 'Oh, I guess I'm a loser. 'A luh-whooooo a za her'.  Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice.
Oh, yeah, sitting on your big fat butt. Alright, that is the number to beat.
All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here. I'd like you to meet somebody. This is the accounting department.
O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site...or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?
Okay, Tuesday. Whenever. You'd better try it on, make sure it fits.
[in the office, imitating the terminator] I'll be baaaaack!  And I am baaaack!
[after a short pause] So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev.  [after another pause] Where you from?
He gives the best back rubs in the office.
How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you.'
It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise!
Jim and Pam and Cece really seem to be clicking. They are totally gelling. It's as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness. And good for them. That's great, because, you know, the paper industry's not gonna last forever.
Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is.
Ugh! God! What happened to you people? [talking like a robot] We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.
Go bag! Where's my go bag?  Where's my go bag?
[ignores Phyllis)] Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.
Eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it.
Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I don't know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late?  Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself something: Do I even like her?  As the Irish poet Bobby McFerrin says, 'Don't worry, be happy.'
Okay. We good? Okay, that's enough Aqua Net.
Well, I don't know what it's gonna be called, but... my point is, the future of this company is now.  And the future... is me.
Well, I think we all know what you're capable of Meredith.
Oh, umm, ever since I started here, I've kept a diary of all my sales.
You know what we need?  We need some couches in here.
Ha! That-- I am not known for that!
Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!
I will be honest with you.  That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault.  The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don't want to take the elevator with her.  And I am holding on to her leftovers. [throws Holly's leftovers in the trash]
[everyone gets up and leaves the conference room] Alright. Alright.  Let's quit while we're ahead.
Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.
[looks at Jim]   Permission to speak on the record?
Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.
Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today.
Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.
No, this is completely the time, this is perfect time.  This is just guys gently ribbing each other, it's what it's all about, just hangin' out.  Enjoying friends, all being the same.  Worker bees.
It's not a limo. It's a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling.
Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good.
No, nothing happened.  I-I swear, nothing happened.  What, I'm, totally being serious.  A gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do I. [laughs] No, seriously, guys, I'm not, I don't want to go into it at all.  It's off limits.  Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while.  It was great.  I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm.  So.
Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don't worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha...  [bumps into something] ... ha ha ha.
I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol.
Ah, I know, everything really. I love it all. I love music.
I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.
[stand up comic voice] But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
No. [into recorder] Saving the world has never been this hard.
Look at his face! Look at his face!
One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift.
Are you a 12-year-old girl? I don't know. There we go.
A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.
[Riding a bicycle down the hallway and singing] Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa la la la la la la la la. [Struggling to stay on] 'Tis the ... ack. [expletive] Hey! [to Pam] I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint...
Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now.
You just said, let me uh... check my notes.  You just said...
Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see. [takes off his coat and tosses it aside] There we go! [Pam brings over the jack and lug wrench] Good. Yes, we have the... all right. [tries the use the jack to loosen the lug nuts]
Yeah, I get those every day after work.
Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight...
I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.
Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?
It is the 'Whitest Sneakers' award! Because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on!
[singing] Runaway train, never come back.  Runaway and I'm never coming back.
[on phone] Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so--
Talk like you're talking to that race. I have a feeling that this could get kind of volatile. So keep it going. [camera shows Devon sitting outside with West Nile]
Hello. I would like a hot dog please. Now, I don't have any money so here is what I would like to do. I leave you here with my watch, and I come back later to pay for the hot dog.
Did you hear about Angela? That's pretty weird.
Holly and I are dating. It's been a week, and I still can't believe it. [sighs] It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can't work for it. It just comes to you.
Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?
I have a proposal, everybody. Listen up. Now, Corporate has been really breathing down my neck to make some pay cuts, but I refuse to fire anyone. So, I was thinking that maybe all of you would take a 10% pay cut and that would save the money. Yeah?
Shhh! Don't excite him. Don't make him excitable. [whispering] Welcome back, Stanley.
Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh! [laughs] Here you go. Take one, take one. It's all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why don't you take two? Because you don't get health care. And uh, faster metabolism.
I am really disappointed in the office's policy on PDA at this moment. I love you. [shakes Holly's hand]
I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's... these are people's lives you're talking about.
Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.
You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish.
A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us.
I know. It's ju- they didn't have any more businessmen. So...
Okay, all right. Let's keep on track. Keep on point. Let's do it.
Tell me if I'm smiling or not. [covers face with hands] Hi Pam, how are you? Was I smiling?
I have been a loyal employee for a long time.
Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can't afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away?
[in video] He has the award-ah! ...it's a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight!
[laughing] Yes. [Olive Oyl impression] Yes my hero!
Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I'm not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat.
[sweaty and chugging water from a bottle] It's so freakin' hot in there. Now I know what Bob Hope was going through when he performed in Saudi Arabia. Man! I got Dwight sucking the funny out of the room, but you do what you can do. [Music starts playing in the background] Here we go, he's early with the cue. Here we go.
Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?
What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we're going to put you in here. Dwight's going to take care of you.
