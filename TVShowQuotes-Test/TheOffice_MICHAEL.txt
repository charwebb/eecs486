And I'm out a fiancee. Are those the customer surveys?
Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?
A murder, you say?  I do declare.
What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?
All right, I'm sorry. God.
It is Jamaican. The exchange rate is 65-to-1. I don't remember in which direction.
No, your job is being my friend, Pam.  OW! God!
Oh, boy. That was yummy. Thank you so much. You know what? I think I left my wallet in my car. Do you mind if I run out and get it?
Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. We're moving to Colorado.
You know what, I can dial 411, get Jim's number.
It's enormous, but it's got wheels.  We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell.  Get the car ready, keep the engine running.
No, I think it is-
Thank you, Stanley.
Dwight, is that a meat sandwich?  You guys hungry?
No. I haven't finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? That's it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybody's getting their chance.
Yeah, well I wasn't very hard to find.
[to press] We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?
Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today.
Thanks Jim.
There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like...
Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable.
Yes.
I will call him later with that message.
[popping his bubble wrap cast] Hey!
Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay.
Yeah! Oh ho ho [laughing]
Oh! She's not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um... no, we're not married... yet!
Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. That's all I'm gonna say. Sex. We had sex. I had sex with her. I had sex with Jan.
Okay, some for, some against.
Kevin. You heard anything yet?
Hey!
Please.
Come on Stanley.  You're losing you.  You're losing you. Do it!
Keep.
Ignorance.
It's not a big deal really, I just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, I picked up her glove so I was hoping I could give it back to her.
Walk with me.
We're party girls.
Oh my God, oh my God.
Oh, good. Okay. Don't tell me, tell them.
Just STAP IT YAP IT!!!!
Here we are.
No, no Dwight. He's just being stupid. [the office laughs]
Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?
Mmm-hmm.  I know.
We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that's who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans.
Okay.
People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We're gonna do a fun one.
What? Wha? You said ten.
Are you making a--
[looking afraid] You can count on me.
[to Ryan, sitting across from Michael] ...You can take a five, if you want.
No! You idiot! [hangs up] Idiot, idiot, idiot! What are you doing? God! Oh my god.  [redials]
[shouts from behind the trees] Uh, it's a sketch now.
You get something good this year?
You're gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I can't handle it. So let's just...let's...
Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so... I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?
Yes, sir.
Any messages?
Yes.  Actually I will tell you right now.  It's a club called Chatroom, and there's a password to get in, which is actually password.  So...
Fine, have your clients.  I can see that's what you wanted all along.  [everyone mutters 'okay'] However, I rescind my apology.
No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway.
What you talking bout, Wallace? [imitating What you talking bout Willis]
He... Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great.
Hmm.
I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.
That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.
Come in.
THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!
Yeah.
Really?
Wow! You did these... freehand?
[annoyed] Andy, would you like to have my baby?
Is it her boobs, or...
[laughing softly] I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it.
But there's no downsizing, so just don't...
Uh...
That sounds pretty biased.
Yes, I will not be.
They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?
Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'...
Our company is worth nothing.  That's the difference between you and I.  Business isn't about money to me, David.  If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company.  And  then another and another and another.  I have no shortage of company names.
I can't Andy, it's too hard. That's-I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that?
This office is cursed.  [sighs]  And we need to do something about it.
Phyllis, Jim? Phyllis is Santa?
Hello. I would like a hot dog please. Now, I don't have any money so here is what I would like to do. I leave you here with my watch, and I come back later to pay for the hot dog.
Very good, Jim. Pam, please note that Jim is very astute. All right, are we ready?
Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I'd love to be a part of one someday.
Okay.
Well, thank you and, and please call - continue to call me Mr. Scott.
Get back, get back.  Come on, get back to the slums.
Hello. Hi. [to Pam] Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me.
Oh, stop it Dwight.
I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted... I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food.
Oh, hey, Toby. So... It's an analogy.
[on the roof] My life!  Oh, my life...
Mmm!  It's after midnight. [points at Jim]
[barging through office door] Alright. Here we go.
Oh. Bad boy. [to Ryan] Um... Ryan? [makes Donald Duck noise]
Because it's a big universe, and we're all just little, tiny specks of dust.
[bending Luke over desk, spanking him repeatedly] You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!
Meredith has an E-vite from Jim.  Barbeque at Jim's tonight.  Tonight?  Wonder where my e-vitation is.  Click on guest list.  Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed.  Must be... .[scrolls down list] No.
Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'.
Oh, right, I'm sorry. What is: we are fine?
[whispers] I don't know.  [normal volume] Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo.  I think I could back out of the sale. [Jan exhales] Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.
[knocks] This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna... Can I help you? Um... I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points...
Jo! We were not expecting you!
Okay. [Jan hangs up. Toby opens the office door.]
We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So let's get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously.  Phyllis, I'd like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area.
Glad you could all make it.
I could have helped.
[at a park throwing whole pieces of bread] Caw... caw... caw caw... caw...
Ok, let's do this thing.  [to Pam] Wish us luck.
Okay.
[in Michael's car] Okay, just throw out all the empties.
It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about.
Pam? Knock, knock.
What's up?
Mmm. No, you said you could man. We're counting on ya. You know you're playing point guard.
I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.
That's unfortunate.  How 'bout the suggestion box?  There's tons of ideas in there.
Probably get soup or something light.
OK, Ryan.  You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?
Yeah. You know what? I am. I'm gonna call her. That's a good idea.
Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you don't. Not even Sabre owns this place. It's a rental. I'm kind of sick of the attitude around here. I'm sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim... I think I am not going to give these to you. [Angela, Kevin and Oscar applaud]
Ladies and gentleman, it is quitting time.
What do you know about management, Dwight?
Eleven pounds...
No.
Let's... be... rational... here. What are the pros? What are the cons?
[singing] Goodbye Toby, it's been nice. Hope you find your paradise...
No, what did you say?
Well we  should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright. [Pam tosses list out car window] Okay...
All right.
Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that [bleep]hole.
Pam I have a loaded gun in my desk at work. If I ever start acting like that weenie Gabe I want you to take that gun, and I want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until I'm dead. Okay?
Thank God.
Because I loves to party and I'm gonna be partying my butt out at this place.
Right. Why would a dog do that? That's silly.
Okay.
Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much.
There you are.  I don't think we have finished with my Inbox.
Who eats eight protein bars?
Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.
I think you're right.
By the bushes?
Your loss.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.
Hey, how'd we do?
Excuse me for a second. [gets up from the table]
...the 'Busiest Beaver' award goes to Phyllis Lapin.
Martin Nash. Okay.
Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi. [Lowering voice] Try my googi, googi. [High-pitched voice] Try my googi, googi. Try my... [slap!]
You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all.
I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you?
We want the same things.
What...
Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan?
Oh, what did you do today?
Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. That'll show 'em.
Ok. Alright. Oh boy.
They have one of those?
Okay, good. Good.
I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling.
So, umm... thanks for coming by. So, I, uh...
No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe...
[starts to speak, says nothing, walks away]
Really? What happened?
Come on!
Seven deadly sins. It's a sign.
I'm sleeping with Pam's mom. Sometimes, dinner.
[to cashier at coffee shop] Thank you very much. Our suspect has straight brown hair. She is wearing blue jeans and a black top. So... behold our bachelorette [cut to a blonde woman in a skirt]. Give her ten for looks and a three for her ability to describe herself. Hello, my lady. [woman walks right by and doesn't respond]
[shaking head disgustedly] Okay... okay. [leaves room]
Dwight, not now, we've been robbed.
OK, what else?
Well the invitation says VIP's only.  Is this how you treat your VIP's, Ryan?  We're already in the city.  The main part with the buildings.  What am I supposed to do?  What do you want me to do tonight?  And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up!  Okay I'm going to throw up.  I'm throwing up.  You're making me throw up, Ryan.
David, they do not believe me. When you told me everyone was canned.
Okay, okay... here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.
Hey, Pam, how bout something like that for you.  Could sort of cover up any imperfections in the mid section.  Just show off the twins a little bit.
You get to look at her.  Why don't you hold out your hand. [hands Brad paper] Tell me what you feel.
We are not in the playground anymore.  There are new rules.  We have to be mature.  But we can't lose the spirit of child like wonder.  What is love...  anyway?  Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules.  Like me and Jan.  Or Oscar... and some guy.  Life is short.  When two people find each other, what should stand in their way?
Her boobs, definitely.
Sure.
...wall-to-wall carpets...
I have been a loyal employee for a long time.
I can't hear you! [less applause]  Heard you a little bit less that time.  Must be...
Um, sort of a spy, thriller...
Andy Bernard. Pros: He's classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons: I don't really trust him.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  It's just the first... girl that popped into my head.  I'll find somebody I haven't slept with.
That is by far the best way to strengthen your core.  This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist.  It strengthens your entire core.  Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it.  I think that's how they got a core.
Yes.
Push it.
Hey, Stanley, is that jacket make of up-dog?
What?
Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there.
Yeah. I am.
[struggling to speak] Mmm--- mmm...  Um...
I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it.
[in the office, imitating the terminator] I'll be baaaaack!  And I am baaaack!
That's not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn't listen to any of that crap.
Ohh..
Mm. That's not gonna happen.
Birthday lunch.  Birthday lunch-- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch.  It'll cure all of your 'Gee I don't know if Michael should be dating my mother' and fixes all occurrences of 'I don't really see them together'.  So, open wide Pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine.  Take with food.
I put Stanley on a pedestal, for a long time.  But sometimes he can just be a big, fat jerk.  I... jerks don't deserve to be on pedestals.  Jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are.  Big marble... jerk stand.
Na, Na-oh, Naa-es.
Dwight! Sign please. I don't have time for parties I don't have time for TV shows. Stanley! What time is that thing I have to do?
No no no no no. I'm not asking it. I'm just reading it out loud.
No, no you're wrong about this.
You called Bob?
David's gone. Alan's gone. We're all gone.
Right.
[yells] THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! [Jan gets an evil look on her face and picks up Michael's dundie and throws it into his plasma screen tv] THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe! [Jan goes upstairs crying.]
Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager?
Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly.
No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously. [Jan looks at Michael]
Oh hey, I know you... Elizabeth?
[upset] I don't get it!
Thank you.
Do you really mean that?
We saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met Michael Klump.
Time out.  You think this kid could be a fighter pilot?
You'll notice I didn't have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just though. 'Too soon for Arabs.' Maybe next year. Um... You know, the ball's in their court.
I was never in this for the money.  But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me.  I tried to live the dream.  I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed.  But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.
You know what?  I don't understand when you all talk at the same time.
I don't want you to feel like I'm baby-sitting you, or something. Alright.
[removing tie] Well, apparently, Michael Scott is on a date. And that, that my friend, changes everything. [puts on backwards golf cap]
I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.
Why are you dressed like that?
Comedy; it's funny.  It's Johnny Carson, Karnak.  It's, um, put it back.  Huhhhh, did you have Johnny Carson in your land?
[in Michael's office] Wow, this is tough.
Yes I do.
Don't-all right. Well, ok, you've just committed a felony.
You, Kelly and Creed, Kevin, they believe in you. Don't let them down. Don't let yourself down, Andy. I'm gonna go back in. I'm going to stall them for a little bit. I want you to get your head together, and then come back in. I want you to close. [entering conference room] [as Mikanos] What is taking that guy so long?
Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up!
Steak! Where's my steeaaak?
What are your symptoms?
Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January; guess what you don't have to do in the spring?  Anything.  They say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind.  Well I say that an empty desk means a...
[putting his shoes back on, talking to the camera crew] Well, I guess this is it. Hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. Alright... Oh! [pulls out his mic from his shirt] This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest. [he hands them the body mic, when he speaks it is inaudible now] That's what she said! [waves goodbye and walks off to his gate, halfway there Pam comes running up to him and they hug for a while. They say their goodbyes to each other, and Michael walks off for good]
Yes.
I'm going to o have some of this meat sandwich.
Campus. Brings back so many memories. ... That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class? [runs over, throws frisbee] Whoo!
Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch 'Lazy Scranton'.
Sad. To soak up my tears.
I hear your voice.
You know what, here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he's just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He's invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It's not Terminator.
Oh how dare you.
That's perfect.
Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-
Ok.
Carol?
You're not from paper?
Thank you.
Okay, weirdo.
Your body only has a certain amount.
Because he's mean.  He's, he's like a really mean-spirited guy.  He talks about how gay Oscar is...
Hey, you embarrassed my friends in front of me and I'm gonna need you to go back over to the table and apologize.
Party central! So, what can I do you for? [Guy leaves] All right.
Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible.
Yes.
He is.
OK.
You know what? We should really do something fun this week.
You're close with Pam too.
Okay. Wow. Oh man! My head just exploded. Whoo! Thank God, for everybody right? Whoo kay. Wow, you're huge! That's incredible! I... God sorry, sorry my head is... I'm just, I'm trying to figure out the last time that you and Jim had sex, and...
There has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue.  My little heart can barely take it no more.  [regular voice] Today is the hardest I have worked in a long, long time.
What are you talking about--
I, I surely do, and don't call me honey. [Jo laughs] You were playing too.
Well Stanley, maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well.
[to Christian] I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say?   They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?
Yep.
All right, we're starting over.
Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off!
Okay, what does that mean?
Finish your cake, Helene.
Sure.  Kevin, please leave.
Distractions are good!  That means conference room, five minutes!  No, no, five seconds!  Right now, right now!  Conference room!  Topic, potpourri!  Let's go!
Andrew, what about you?
Okay... that's...
Yeah...
OK everybody. Get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every Monday for the next seven Mondays.
Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.
Uh huh. [gestures to Kevin to keep it quiet] Alright?
OK, well I know. You told me that several times.
Nothing. Let's just... all right. [talks to warehouse guys] Guys, do you have a box we could use?
Guys, guys-
So what you're saying is you kinda like it? [Phyllis impression] I've fallen and I can't get up! [normal again] That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good.
Okay.
Dwight?
I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan.
Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w---
Sick freak! What is wrong with you?
Uh, that's what she said.  See, haven't lost my sense of humor.  No, no need, it was a non-stick grill.
I need you to do something for me.
What does that even mean? That is impossible.
Very nice! [Borat voice]
I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology.  The press wants a story, I will give them a story.
No it's not.
The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike.
Oh. Koselli. With the Jello.
You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
Oh, well.
Ugh!
Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, what's going on?
What are you doing?
French. Classy.
[waving to Christian]  See ya.
Yeah, but no, seriously. Uh, you know, he's not a member of the full staff so, uh, Ryan you wanna just step outside?
Oscar, are you Santaria?
Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?
What is that?
What? Really?
Road trip!  Right?
No, just get me a case. [Dwight looks at the camera, lifts his leg onto the desk, removes the sheath from his ankle, and gives it to Michael]  All right.
Yes, big if.
Of course.
I... will skip a turn.
Oh, come on.  We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul.
Okay.
Listen, why don't we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability.
I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, you'll be fine.
I have not found that to be the case.
Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything.
No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage.
[grimacing] That's what she said. [leaves]
Alright [takes Jan's coat].
Noon.
[enters office, somersaults onto couch, kicks over painting and lamp] Parkour!
I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?
Pam, everybody! [starts clapping]
Hey. Who wants to watch Michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he's bringing it over.
[pulls a brand new mug out of his desk door] That won't be necessary.
I want my old job back.  I want my old parking space back.  I want a Sebring.
[escorts Erin off stage] There you go.
Yup.
Uh... no.  Did anybody see a package here today?  No.  How big was it?
Yes.
[throws the sack of garbage onto the floor] Eight Years.
Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up.
Pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.
So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.
Okay, here's what we're going to do: I'm going to instruct the kids about management and sales. Oscar will be in charge of accounting. Pam will be eye candy. No... uh, also, because that is your alma mater. Darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. We don't have to worry about internships with them, because they definitely ain't going to college.
Going into nuclear something; that's not where the scene was going.
Ok.
...trid Levinson.  Hi!  Astrid, this is everybody, look.  This is your family.  You're going to know them for the rest of your life.
Cool. What next? [Dwight puts his face on scanner]
Andy, Cornell called, they think you suck. And you're gayer than Oscar. Boom. Roasted. [Stanley is still laughing] Alright. Alright everybody, you know I kid, you know I kid. You guys are the reason I went into the paper business, so, uh, goodnight, God bless, God bless America, and get home safe. [clapping and murmurs of appreciation]
Waste? What does that even mean? Like garbage?
David? David?
Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal?
Oh good.  Okay cool.  How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?
That is so sweet.  You are the best GD girlfriend in the world.  Do you know that?
Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today. They invited me to their hospitality suite where I  had free food and it was delicious. Get this. Know how nice they are? The sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in Scranton. That's -
Oh yay! Geography joke. [still laughing, notices the time] Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, let's all go home. Come on. See you all tamale.
She's right on my way home from work.
Yeah.
I am feeling this. Call it the Holy Spirit or the passion of the Christ. I am loving these people.
Oh, thanks.  This is the guy that beat the computer.
...I think we all know what award Pam is going to be getting this year.
Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it's talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, I'm done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work.
It's Ryan the WUPHF guy!'
Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.
Like we're going to the science museum.
I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?
Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didn't love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes.
Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges.
I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.
You are gonna get seasick if you keep reading in here.
Uhhh it's ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don't understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?
Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster.
I am really disappointed in the office's policy on PDA at this moment. I love you. [shakes Holly's hand]
It's been a rough couple of weeks.
Oh my God! Run! Run! It's a setup. Setup!
Mmhmm.
Hey Pack-man.
Right, but 20 years ago we couldn't and that is amazing. Here's Toby from Human Resources. This is Katy. Toby, Katy.
Stanley, you love your Sudoku and your puzzles, I bestow upon you, my felt. [gives Stanley a small felt table] May you never lose the fun loving quality in life.
No. I think I will pass.
What? Problem solved.
Is it a good plan?
I'm not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend. [all seem to be in agreenment] And he's also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what? Even if he doesn't, I would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground.
Is it going to be worth it?
We're very excited too, aren't we guys? Right?
If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say,  'apology accepted', I think we would all feel better.  And then we can break out  my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark.
Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up.
My main concern, should I have a safe word?
[after Phyllis leaves suddenly] What is she so upset about?
Love it.
OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half.  I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.
Yeah... you are... ah, so right.  They had visual aids.  And all we had were the facts.  You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity.  You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science.
By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.
[sighing] It was unanimous, Toby.
Ok.
[in unison] Summer!
Woooo![laughs] I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.
- and to King Meredith! [hands her a lead]
Wait, what?
The Electric City. Scranton!
They don't know that!
Hello.
What are... What are you doing?
No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.
There we go. Our town car awaits.
Woo hoo.
I am about to give blood.  The gift of everlasting life, the transfer of my bodily fluids, oh wow, that's a big needle, that --
[in the cheese cart] Be my eyes.
In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me.  But the truth is, I can't do this.
Okay.
Mmhmm. Yeah, that's right.
Nope.
...There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right?
There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam.
A surveillance room next to this one.
I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. [David grins]
Adapt. React. Re-adapt. Act. All right? That's rule number two.
Any nuns?
Apparently, there are allegations that Sabre printers can cause a fire. So they asked me to give a statement to the press. I'm like, what? All right. So I do it. It's on TV last night. And it's in the paper today. And it's online. And then I call Froggy 98.7, the request line. I talk to the host about it on the air. It's like, come on, people, enough.
There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello [kisses Carol] You're about five hours early to the party. You're such a blonde. [laughs]
No, you--no.
And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.
No, this is completely the time, this is perfect time.  This is just guys gently ribbing each other, it's what it's all about, just hangin' out.  Enjoying friends, all being the same.  Worker bees.
[hangs up and composes himself] Yes, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm, I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I head to the airport at four. [looks at the list of members of the office, with some names crossed out] And I have said goodbye to half of them.
I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids. [Michael sees it's the end of a street.] OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back,  should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it.
What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we're going to put you in here. Dwight's going to take care of you.
Nobody should have to go to work thinking, 'Oh, this is the place that I might die today.'  That's what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying.  An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... An office is a place where dreams come true.
You did?
All right.  All right, everybody, we're leaving.  Jan and Astrid are leaving.
I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it.
Nothing much is happening today. We are having our photo IDs taken. Whoop-de-doo. Can't always be like The Apprentice.
I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.
You're going to mess with me, is that what you're going to do? I'll tell you something Charles, I don't even care. Cause I've got nothing got lose. [Charles steps towards Michael] Oh my God, OH GOD! No no, all right. Fine, it's not even worth it.
[talking to the speakerphone] Will her highness, Jan Levinson-Gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton?
A woman spurned.
Good question.  Forrest Gump: mentally challenged, Philadelphia [points to a picture from Big]: AIDS.
Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!
Don't you work here full-time?
You know, I would like to try the luge, through.
There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees.  His salary, that would depress them.  His bed, it---  And I am not going to tell them that I'll be reading their e-mails.
Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty.
I know, it's unbelievable.
I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.
I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that?
Cause that's...
Alright.  Well fight it out amongst yourselves.  I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.
That's right!
[on speakerphone in Dwight's car] Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn.
Come on, seriously, that?
There is no way he ditched me. There is no way that happened. He's my... Ok. May I please just use your phone? Please!
And classy, yeah.
How many miles did he do last year?
Oh ok. For how long?
Why?
My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been [makes slashing neck hand motion] swack, divorced.  Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we'll be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing.  We just sort of got caught up in the moment.  The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager.  Just, uh, she didn't want it to continue for some reason.  It, we both, I didn't want it, we both didn't want it to continue.  Was not professional.  Um, when people say something's mutual, it never is.  But this was mutual.
Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket.
No! [under his breath] God.
Electricity.
No, I did not.
No. No. No. No. No. No. Respectfully, Toby, no. No. This company does not waste time or resources, ever. [clip montage]
That's ridiculous.
You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.
Uh huh...
Kevin.
Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He'd always get rolled over by something.
[laughs] Does anybody else know about this?
Hey, hey.
I have essentially. Yes. I've taken some...
Here we go!
Um, I am sort of a master of distraction.  When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class.  Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies?  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  [Michael covers his mouth and makes fart noises.]
I want to keep those so I can see what I sent.
I've been trying. I've been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird.
That is the way you're supposed to do it, idiot.
I'll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions...
[looking at nothing] Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.
You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers... mon.
Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. That's not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other.
No, no, obviously older.
[kicking through rubbish at the dump] You've changed, man.
[screams] Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!
No.
With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? That's what people like.
Do you understand, you forced my hand?
I suppose summer had to end sometime. It's sad, though, because I had a great summer. I got West Nile virus, lost a ton of weight. Then I went back to the lake. I stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, which hurt. That got infected even though I peed on it. Saw 'Inception.' Or at least I dreamt I did.
Merry Christmas!
Exactly, thank you.
Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march.
[looks at Andy who is urging he agree with her, Michael turns around] Okay, let's go to Hayworth's.
[in the background] How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don't know either.
Mhmm, no I paid 500 dollars for that.
Oh, I hate monkeys.
Don't worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.
Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right.
Does his family know?
But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you.
We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move...
Million dollars!
Did you know I used to be in HR?
It rained.
Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend.
That is true.
So from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, I am sorry.
Absolutely. Is this mine or is this Chili's?
Was I, Creed?!  Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank.  Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of.  Ok?  Now that we've learned this, let's continue.  See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out.  'You need to do something about your coffee breath'-
We are in the heart of it. [Bathroom sounds rattle the small office.] And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.
Yes.
High five! [Borat voice]
You think that's funny.
This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole Pam situation.
Who?
Okay.
Yes! Wallace said there would be one of those.
Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.
Oh, alright, yeah.
I'll call you later.
Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don't respect the father who doesn't respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?
I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around.
Be careful. Oh no!! [Phyllis and Bob smear cake on each other's face] Oh wow! Phyllis! Phyllis! You look like a clown! Here. Get me! Get me! [Michael smears cake on his own face]
Ok.
Oh, umm... [looks at Post-It on computer]
I will call you when it is time. [Jim and Dwight leave]
Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke?  Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?
I did not, not, not use those words.
Well, apparently, my insurance will not be covering this hospital stay.  I will be paying out-of-pocket.  Um... I kinda wish I'd been hit by a car.
Get your eyes checked, chucklehead.
Right.
Look at his face! Look at his face!
Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now.
Thank you.
Uh, ow.  Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN!
That would be hot. I would pay to see that.
Hi.
Oh, good.
Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.
We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers.
And?
My point is... that as long as people like you and me don't stop talking, nobody can stop the USA.
It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier.
Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?
I'm just a bee, Dwight, ok, just a bee, just buzzin'.
Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey. [to Kelly] Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring... [to Stanley] We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan.
Ok, [lifts up cooked foot] what does this look like to you Stanley?!
I know. I don't wanna get ahead of myself, but I think I want her to meet my mom.
Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Who's your daddy? You don't know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don't. [to Jan] Come on. Let's go in.
And he was laughing.
I did?
Hey.
No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go. [Michael spits out key, Jim covers it with his foot.]
Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.
That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus.
Hello, Stanley.
If you didn't badger me with so many questions, Pam, I could be done with it by now.
Sure we do.
What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. [points to Pam] Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.
You are.
Okay.
It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a Sex Ed class.
Good, what's funny?
You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office.  Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary.  The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes.  I don't know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming.
All right. We are infinitely sorry.
Oh, hey no biggie. Just...
Nobody better try to stop me. Good. [leaves the office. door closes]
That's it? You're going to end with 'etcetera'? Okay, what's this big organizational system that...
Dwight just got Howard Family Dry Cleaners.
Cool.  Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin.  I was thinking we could name the company something like, 'Paper Great.  Where great paper is our passion.  We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!'  I don't know, could be good.  Or, uh, 'Super Duper Paper.  It's super duper.'  I don't know, something like that.
You looked freaked, man. We said 'Surprise.' You were, like, 'What?' 'What the hell's goin' on here?' Good cake. Why don't you have some?
Okay, it doesn't say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it's policy, it should say it on the coupon.
Ok.
Toga!
All right, how about some presents?  I want to see some presents. [holding a memo pad] I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes.
Where is my little nibblet?  Halpert, room D1.  Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you.  Here we go.
I agree.
It's not... Nevermind. Nothing. [arguing voices]
How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator.
[walks back in, on cell phone] What? Oh my God!  [everyone starts asking questions]  There has been a murder.  There's been a murder in Savannah. [runs back to his office]
Good work. I'm proud of you. [Pam and Oscar leave] Mother-
See? I was his number 1 contender. I was being groomed.
All of them.
You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don't break the branches, Dwight.
This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.
[stops dance] Nothing.
See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim.
Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.
This is bull****!
No. She'd just resent me. Or worse! She would think of me as her friend. [disgusted voice] Oh, hi friend! Blegh.
I could go for an appeteaser.
[sees Holly and Todd shaking hands in the conference room] Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldn't be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.
Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled!  Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let's get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.
Okay, alright.
Oh.
Hey, uh, can I help you out in here?
I love you-love you.
Uh... I can't really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection.
Jim's a good kid. He can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master. I, uh... why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional?
Blackula!
Is she crazy in bed?
How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, 'I told you so.'  Gently with a rose?  In a funny way, like it's a hilarious joke?  Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way.
[claps his hands twice] It is done!
No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight.
Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.
he works... Okay hold, hold on, hold on. Look. Look. I didn't say anything when Phyllis' dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this. Kay.
Tonight, I can't do it tonight, no.  Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds-
Nothing, I just...
[sighs]
Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right?  [to Katy] So how's that uh, coffee from earlier?
And tell him the joke.
So far, these are my leads.  A blind tollbooth operator and a twelve hundred pound catcher.  It's a start.
A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is 'Jamaican Jan Sun Princess.'
Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first.
Yes.
It's $1.99 to finish the article.  I wonder what it was going to say? [no one makes a move to pay for the article]
I Braveheart.  I am.
Yeah.
And when they came over on the Mayflower.  Bow chicka bow.
[as Curly] Why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh?
Five o'clock.  Time to go get my improv on. [drinks]  Little bit of the comedy juice.  Mmm.  Alright, see if you can guess what this is. [roars and flails his arms]  That is a dinosaur getting ready to go to improv class.  Just a taste of the improv.
[climbs under desk] Hey, look at me, I'm a baby! I'm one of those babies from 'Look Who's Talking.' What am I thinking? [Laughs] Look at all those staplers! What's a stapler!? I don't even know, I'm a baby! Hey, Mom, I'm thirsty! I'm thirsty, Mama! I want some milk. And you know where milk comes from! Breasts.
[comes into the conference room in a Santa hat and beard]  Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, [points to Ryan] pimp. I'm kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting?
[to camera] When I let him come to my pick-up game...
Well, I am heading down there.
At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I don't know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people.
Paul Newman, Robert Redford. They're bank robbers.
Why do you hate her?
[tea bags on eyes] Do I feel badly, that nobody out there was invited to a party that I was invited to?  Not at all.  Because they have to know that if they work hard and apply themselves, someday, they could be invited to a party like this.  Of course, at that point, I will be going to much better parties that they will not be able to get into.  What are you gonna do?
And the sequel, 'Woman Stands at Desk and Works.' So, I have no idea how you, [he sits on the floor] how you sit like that.
Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake.
Exactly.  Here, here are my sure things.  I blindfold her.  I take her to the Houdini Museum.  She chains me up...
They are into appearance. We are selling success.
Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast.
[reads email] 'I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business.'
Pamela Beesly Halpert--
Bull[censored] man!
Probably the best one that we have ever had, right? [cheers and applause] But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter.
[emerging from convenience store with two ice cream sundaes] Hey, look at that. Fun, right?
If I just went away right now, would that be the best gift that I could give you?
No!
[caught by camera crew dancing to 'At the Car Wash', but laughing] Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso.
Lethal Weapon?
Maybe some Italian. [voice on phone] '... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -' [Jan takes the phone away from her ear] Chinese? [voice on phone] 'who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy.'
He was, but, uh... that desk was empty.  He'd come in and sit there sometimes.
Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay.
You just said 'part of your duties are to' something.
Why... are you here?
[everyone is lying on the floor in the conference room with the light off, Michael is walking around with a candle in his hand] It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance.
Why did I do it? I don't know. Jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary. But she already brought the diary with her to New York, so... You expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend.
I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it's not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesn't exist. Or that the sport doesn't exist? I should've known. Poopball?
Well, that figures.  So how did you deal with people not liking you?
Hello, Dwight.  Pam left her iPod at her house.  I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital.  We need it yesterday.
Yes.
[holds up Blackberry] Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?
This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.
My biggest fear is turning into him.
Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there. [clears throat] Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isn't tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight. [clears throat again] So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought [choking up, clears throat again] sorry. [laughs nervously] I think I have a frog in my throat. Um... [sigh] I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um... [Michael walks off stage, knocking over the snare drum]
That's so spicy.
This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.
The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones.
I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to...[Erin snaps a picture of Michael] lunch.
Okay, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for Cat's Cradles. Burned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets.
I'm in the, I'm in the sex shop.
Don't. Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.
Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?
God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?
Toby, Katy.
We already have a sofa. So why do---
No, I'm serious, we don't have to put up... Is it the dogs?
Hmmm, dare I? [laughs]  You know what? I'm going to, for old time's sake.  [walks to the annex, standing in Toby's cubicle] Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex. [turns around and sees Toby]
Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan?
I don't care. I have an appetite for life! [eats cake] Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That's Lemon.
[laughs]  Ohh...Nah.
Well, you didn't even hear it.
All right. Are we good? [Luke runs out crying] You're okay. He's okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.
Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.
We have a little song prepared for you.
Sorry?
That is not constructive.
He's not going to be a murderer.
That's one of 'em! Yes.  These are our demands.  This is what we want.  Our balls are in your court.
Presents. I got presents for everybody. Dwight, a genuine Rastafarian wig.
Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips...
Who wants candy?
Just the bread, it's fresh baked.
Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that.
Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please... [imitates drum roll] Can anybody guess?
No, that's not... no, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you.
Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no?
Just-in case. What's your last name?
Oh shoot.
No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.
Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.
What was Dwight thinking?  That he could turn Jan against me?  She's my ex-lover!  ...ish.
What?
So, I guess we're getting back together.
Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.
Mm-Hmm.
No, it's not. Just shut up.
Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better.  I'm not in this for the trophies, but...
Well we can do better than that.
OK, who's hungry [Kevin starts to put hot dog in mouth] No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest. [sighs at the table] For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set.
[disappointed] Okay... [Jim is confused]
Really?
Hellooo? ... Please don't send Dwight!
I disagree, I think it was very valuable.
No sales topic per se.
Uh...
I don't think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary.
Yeah?
[bus stopping] Okay, well, a pleasure. Go save the world. We'll keep an eye on America for you.
Whoa!
Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?
[waving goodbye as the bus drives away] See you in a few months.
Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
[Clears throat] I don't think I can sign this.
Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.
Yeah!
Love.  Marriage.  Baby carriage.  Those have been my goals ever since I heard that song.  Jan and I had love.  We did not have marriage.  We did have a baby carriage, which I got her for bringing groceries home, after she got a DUI.
You enjoy the second act.
Shhh! Don't excite him. Don't make him excitable. [whispering] Welcome back, Stanley.
Smell that. Do you smell that?
Uh...
Oh!
Could we get a Delorean?
Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt. [they glare at each other]
Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker.
Yeah.
We can talk about that. [Dwight high fives Michael] All right.
OK.
No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.
...empathy, respect... [Phone ringing] Jim! Jim!
The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.
Yes we do.
This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis' father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, aren't you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can't believe I'm actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Let's do it.
No.  No, I meant about being single today.
Keep it up. And there's Stanley. No costume? Well, no, not trying to fit in. I wish I had your confidence, I really do.
...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas.
Okay, Dwight.  Let me explain something to you.  I set the rules and you follow them.  Blindly. Okay?   And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department.  It's a trash can.
Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you?
I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she's allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read 'Lonesome Dove' three times.
Rule three: Reach for the stars. And if you fail, see rule four. Rule four: Failure is not an option.
Hey.
Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through? [Pam pushes a button the phone] Hi buddy.
Okay. [reaches out and shakes Darryl's hand] Okay.
All right.
I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam.
Hey hey!
How do they do this so fast?  Is this power-point?
I umm, thought about getting a tattoo on my back as well at one point. I was thinking about getting 'Back to the Future.'  'Back' because it's on my back and 'Future' because I'm the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future. I just think a tattoo should mean something, you know? And it's my second favorite movie.
That is a lucky number. Seven. 7-Up. Seven dwarfs.
Look at where you're going to be doing the cartwheel. So look at where you're going to be placing your hands. So pick a spot.
Have a seat.
I'm not playing.
... and I feel free!
Oh. It was awesome. Very, very sublime.
Stuff. I love stuff.
David, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse.
I don't kn--
Okay, orange slices. There ya go.
Can you believe... cause I know paper.  I know everything there is to know about paper.
[groans] And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.
I didn't say anything!
Scooch. Before I shoot you in the head.
Squarepants?
Life-size.
If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.
Do you fast food?
Yes pleeeeease!  Thank yooouuu!
Oh, my god. This is it.
You listen to me. You listen good. You are are
Come on people, let's get 'em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards!
Or is it?
It's your delivery...
[to Brad coming out of the bathroom] Hey.
Dwight, do you have the box?
I will take care of that.
I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart.' I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, 'Mr. Brown,' he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears.
[gestures to 'Bed & Breakfast' magazine] Is this good?
I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.
Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.
What are you... [whispers to Bill]
Okay.
I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don't see you anymore.
Well I'm sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey! [snaps in front of sleeping old man] I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper.
I didn't give you $40.
Is there another option?
[sighs]  I wasn't talking literally, Creed.  Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy?  Why am I talking to you?
I'm not wearing a wire, so...
Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-
Really?
Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so that's sort of a repair.  Alright, I'll let you guys talk.
Or sooner.
Hey, doc?  You forgetting something? [pediatrician takes a lollypop from his pocket and gives it to Michael]  Thank you.
Oh you don't, that's-
Okay! [Bob Vance and Michael in an all-out sprint, Michael grunting]
Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.
Woo hoo, shout out!
Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.
I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you.
It doesn't have to mean anything.  Just, do it for Stanley.  Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley.  Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies.
Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my God! [laughs]
I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now he's probably going to get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I don't know what is.
Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. You're funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date?
No, I'm not going to settle down.
Yeah.
Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim.
Hello, Stephanie. Ok, where is he? [looks into empty office]
Orgasms, why can women have them? Yep?
I am a bank teller.
I went medieval on his heinie.
You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch. [in pirate voice] It's me own damn fault. Woman in every port.
Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?
Well, you can't swim in leather pants. [laughs] I'm just yankin' your chain.  Not literally.
I want another try. Here we go! [Michael runs past the radar as a car passes] Thirty-one! Thirty-one!
Guilty.
What?
Why
Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It's what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.
You know, David.  I don't care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me.
I'm just calling because you responded positively to the---
It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident about a decision in my life.
That was a bunt.
I am?
I'm just kidding. Coconuts for your coconuts!
Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?
And my new favorite restaurant sucks... I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? ... I miss Holly.
All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But don't you call it that, I've earned the right.
How late do we have to work tonight?
Oh.  What is this?
Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.
What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her 'partner' in to work? [to Toby] Would that be crossing the line?
Right, I'm gonna spend the day in the hospital, bujehh.  Bureaucracy and germs.
Definitely.
[pulls out a recorder and speaks softly into it] T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert. [starts to cry] You started with this company, as a fine young man...
Jan, you... complete... me.
Si senor.
You still don't know.
A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that's why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It's um, it's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school.
[on phone] Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks?
Yes, your corner. Go.
OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?
That kid's going to have a lot of hair.
The Electric City. Scranton!
It's gonna be fun.
Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager.
If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody.
Does anybody have anything?  Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?
How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17% and in the US it has only risen by 8%?
You know what? I'll help. I will...
[singing] Yeah, all the homies
Okay.  If I give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.
No. No.
Daddy's here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
You look great! And you're a princess?
Was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have sex at some point?
Return.
Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?
He doesn't need to sit, he's a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.
I'm just gonna call her.
Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition.  Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition.  I'm so, so sorry.
Large. If it's a medium I send it back. If it's an extra large I send it back.
Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.
I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy.
And to King Angela! [hands her a lead] Because today we are all kings. And queens [pats Oscar's shoulder].
Ahhhhhh! [laughs] Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?
Well, Pam and I have eloped. Actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam. [laughs] No, uh,  seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except Nashua, still a little bit raw there. Um, but I am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter. [looks at Pam] Oh that, well, that is Pam. Pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy.
Hmm, hmm.
No! You can't have any candy!
Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay?
No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.
Don't do what I say, say what I do.
Mmhmm!
Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second...
All right, call-- [leans in to kiss Pam]
Hey! Look at what you're wearing again, Pam. Have you ever seen a magician's assistant?  That's...
[leaving his office, hurrying to Jim's office]
Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee.
No, we are not.
[stutters] We'll have to talk--
Saving him!
David will always beat Goliath.
I almost worked there.
Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you. [Kelly sprints inside Victoria's Secret] Come on. Get in here.
Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good.
Pam, could I see you in my office?
So I'll know where---
And Gromit. [David sighs] Jan? Is Jan there?
Maybe.
All right.
Okay... umm... I'm sure that Bob... Wow. That is... that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah... Are you set on that hairstyle?
Huh.
This is where the magic happens.
With dissatisfied clients, it doesn't matter what you did. All they wanna hear is that you're sorry. They're like women that way. And this client is a woman. So when I say I'm sorry, it will be twice as effective.
Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don't know, make yourself to home. This is our casa.
Ow! [grunts, stumbles to his feet] You never forget. Whoo!
Hug it out, bitch.  That is what men say to each other, after a fight.  They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go.  And walk away.  And they're done.  Not a good idea to say that to a woman however.  I have found.  It doesn't translate.
[points at Jim] Arrogance.
How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive.
Billy, your nurse is hot.
Oh, oh, oh!  We'll get somebody to clean that up.
Okay.
[sighs] Come up with a joke that I can use, okay?
All right.
Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill.
Just words. Inspiring words. [under breath] Not a contender. [out loud] For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.
Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day.
Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes.
What? What?
It's frontward's.
Well, I hope this conversation has helped.
Toby!
Goooood morning, Viet-Nashua! Sales. Sales is what bwings us together, today. How do we deal with clients who say, 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn... about paper' and get them to 'Show us the money!' Well, we are going to find out today. Show of hands. How many of you are salesmen? Let's see the salesmen. [some raise their hands] Oh, okay. Well I know what the rest of you are thinking. Wow, yuck. Salesmen are the worst! They are awful. They are so arrogant. They think the whole place revolves around them. Handsome, good listeners, funny, Mr. Wonderful. So, okay, you're a salesman. What's, uh, what's your name?
[to Abby] Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?
[covering eyes] Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part.  Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it.  And I want it someday, but just in the future.  You need somebody who-- who understands your references.  Who is Kafkaesque?  I've never-- I don't know him.  There's another woman.  And her name is Italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping.
Yes.
Oh, [taking it to heart] lazy. Uh huh.
Well... no, I'm not. So I... I'm not very articulate today, so I'll just leave it for another time. Another day.
Stop crying.
Toby actually gets alimony from his ex-wife because she makes more, so that's kind of embarrassing. Not that I'd mind, but it would never happen to me because I would make the marriage work. People seem to like him because they think he's one of us, but he's not. He's this weird loner who just tells people, 'Don't do this, don't do that. Hire this person for this reason.' I would complain about him, but who would I go to, to complain about Toby? Toby. Bias. And what does he do about that? Nothing. Because he's Toby. What kind of name is that? It's almost a girl's name. I think I've known more girls named Toby than guys. He just kind of makes my skin crawl a little bit. Toby is the devil. Toby's the devil.
That was the curse, Stanley, and we are trying to find the cause of the curse.
I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.
OK, OK! So you'll reconsider?
I heard you drug---  I heard you dealt.
Okay.
My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it. [sighs] ... How much?
Leader... ship. The word 'ship' is hidden inside the word 'leadership,' as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork!
I understand that, Dwight.
[misses another shot] What is wrong with me today?!
Ok. Alright. Well, I know a guy. This Mexican guy. He is a math whiz. He knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and I am going to call in a little favor.
It is not a waste of our time.
Well, he's just thinking about his own gifts.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
For Holly.
Okay... Sherri?
And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die.
Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid. [Dwight takes the Polaroid and crumples it in his hand]
The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright?
Stop spraying me!  Gimme the bottle!
We'll go.  I'm still recovering. So let's just, Ryan, could you get my coat please.
Dwight--
And tolerance.
[in a monk-impression tone] Ohmmm... Ohmmm... Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me. [Meredtih sits Indian style in a dress exposing herself right in front of Michael] Ohmmm my God if you're wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm...
[hands Ryan pencil]  There you go.
Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project.
So how do you search?
You can call. Can you call 'em?
[on phone] Hello.
Hey.
Doctor David Friendly's Egg Yolk Diet.  It's, it's kind of unique.  It's just, my diet the last couple months has consisted mostly of eggs yolks and cottage cheese.  And, um, what you do, you don't just have the egg yolks, it's not like a Rocky thing.  You do like hard boiled eggs and I got one a those melon ballers [shot of Michael peeling boiled egg] and I, it's just like a little ice cream scoop, and I just scoop out the middle of the egg and just pop it in my mouth.  I don't even, I don't even use a plate anymore.  Uh, the first couple weeks I did, but you know what, boom, I keep a melon baller in my desk so if I have a hard boiled egg [Jenna breaks as Pam and laughs] I know, I know!  But you know what?  It's perfect.  I know it sounds ridiculous, it sounds ridiculous, but you know what?  Dr. David Friendly, he came up with this thing.  The guy, I think he was like four hundred pounds when he started, and he started with this... I, well, the melon baller was my idea.
Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are--
Alright, he's on his way up. Okay. Are we ready?
Alcohol is a drag. Yes.  Here's what I'd like to do.  I'd like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us.  I'll begin.  This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this.  That's how your drinking affected me.  Anybody else?  Another time when Meredith's drinking affected you?   Come on people.  If we don't say anything she's not going to get any better.  [Kevin raises his hand] Yes, Kevin.
On one hand I want to be honest with Jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand I'm afraid she's going to dump me.
I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio?
Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?
[confused] Stanley was on your group date?
Because that is how my mind works.
No you didn't.
Good luck.
What?
[Burp] Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I'm getting a stitch. [groans]
Okay. A lame attempt at humor.  Swing and a miss.
She is. Very fair and very kind. So... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It's still very cool. Ok. Thanks!
Andy, I got you a genuine Jamaican T-shirt. They love Milli Vanilli down there.
Yeah.
So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus.
Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
And that. Is why. I need a smart intern.
Lifeline.
Give me the pointer.
Wait, you still don't know...
Yes.
NO!
[crying] I can't do this. All the channels are gonna be different there. I'm not gonna be able to find my shows. I'm not going to start improv at level one, and I don't think my credits will transfer. Ugh, and you know what? I just figured out where I was supposed to go to vote. [picks World's Best Boss mug out of the trashcan and puts it back on his desk] I gotta call her, and I'm going to tell her, that I cannot come. [dials on his phone]
No. No. No.
I miss the old Dunder Mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate.
I think it's going to be any minute now.
How do I explain this to Jan?
Oh. [She whispers in his ear. Michael starts to laugh] That's what she said.
That was nice of you.
Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly.  And then I met Helene.  And she is great and she already knows and has done everything  that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it.  But, I think I want to do those things myself.
Federal and State. [no one bids]
It won't.
Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.
A kindergarten teacher, who is great with kids, maybe an ex-model, and now she wants to do something with her brain?
You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de-
No, you lost those clients.
Don't take that dress. Stop it, Jan.
Look at that! [grabs sonogram from Pam] That is the inside of your vagina! [Jim takes sonogram from Michael]
I took a lot from other poems.
Oh.
Fine. Fine.
Thank you.
It's okay guys... I can handle this.  Everybody can go home.
Here's the thing. Chili's is the new golf course.  It's where business happens.  Small Businessman Magazine.
[while Jake is throwing things at Michael] They want how many spiral pads?
No. This is my toast.  I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it.
[hears a taxi honking] Oh shoot! That's my cab.
Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood.
I had a great idea until you ruined it.
Ok.
No, I don't-this doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.
These people just don't realize what a gift basket means, they don't get it.
These are not my shoes. This is just like that show 'Taxi Cab Confessions'.
No? okay, fine.
I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing.
That's not...
That's what she... a lot of places are like that.
Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on.
No is not an option.
Please, Kevin.  You're fired.  [Kevin looks at Jim; Jim shakes his head]  Sorry, sorry.  Work with a bunch of idiots.  Shall we go?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over here, over here. [Jim saves the ball from going out of bounds and passes to Michael] Here we go. Three! [Shoots and misses] Let's go to the zone! We're going to zone!
That's why you made the decision. That's why you made...
Did you see Born on the Fourth of July?  I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy.
Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.
[knock on door] Yeah.
Fair enough.
That's not the point.
No more brain damage!
How's everybody doing today?
Bye.
Good. [Pam stands up and starts reading note] N-no no no, don't.
All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I'm going to cover for you. [shouts] All right!
Nuhh...
... Dwight, they embarrassed us...
Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.
[reading from computer] My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.
She poses.
Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.
Finally.  Right?  Ok, Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams.  Why don't you have a seat?  [Phyllis sits] Let's all clap at Phyllis. [everyone claps] Ok!  [in Michael Clump voice]  When Michael Clump wants to remind you [normal voice] that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy.  And in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly.  Kelly.  [kneels down in front of Kelly, Dwight tries to help him down, Michael shouts gibberish at him]  Kelly, I want you to stand up on your chair.  Come on, stand up on your chair.  Stand up, stand up, stand up.  Somebody help her.  Here we go. [Kelly stands up on her chair] Ok, I want you to look at her.  She's a beautiful Indian woman.  Why?  What makes her beautiful?
[bent over] I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it. [Creed,Stanley, and Oscar pass by in the cab and get out at the finish line]
Yep.
[looking at Creed] Well, he may not be here. Say hello!  OK, here we go. [lifting the car seat high above his head] Lion King!
Well, you can't get diseases from a bird!
Except driving.
Ehhhh....
I just went out for a walk.
All right, all right, shh!
An office... is as safe as the people in it.  And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office.  That's the danger I found myself in today.  I saved a life.  My own.  Am I a hero?  I really can't say.  But, yes.
Why do you lie, liar?
Whew, oh God. [inhales] Laying a base. Laying a base...
Oh my God!
Hmm.
[looks momentarily flattered, but thinks better of it] Kelly.
What's his name?
What are you writing? [Dwight writes in diary]
No one's even going to notice.
I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you... there we go! [Michael's picture pops up on the PowerPoint screen] Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.
That was a hit job.  If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster.  So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I'm not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own.
Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?
So uh, you know what? I usually don't allow solicitors in the office but today I am going to break some rules, and you can have the conference room. It's yours. All day.
Ohh, I do not have much time... car's all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind when I say... say these things, that... are bad things... that you hear... in your ears... this is something that I, if I were you, that I wouldn't want to hear...
Pac-man [imitating the noises of the video game Pac-man eating dots]
Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance. [generalized clapping and cheering] Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!
Well, sometimes.  Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl.  [knock on the door]  Yes?  Oh good, good Stanley!  First victim, this is what I want you to do.  Go out, come back in.  We're going to hide.  I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?
Okay.
Here we go, let's sit down.
Well the number three is not such a giant feast.
Ok, I'm fine, no I know, I'm good, I'm good, it's just.
It's the best.  It's the best.  I would not miss it for the world.  But if something else came up, I would definitely not go.
There she sat.  Her name was Pam.  She was a receptionist.  She was engaged to an animal.  There sat Jim.  He was a gawky, tall salesman.  The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able.  I made a family!  I got these two together, and I made a family.
I didn't feel much when I held Astrid, but I got a good feeling from Holly.
So the kid's making the noise to pick it up.
[flashback the photo being taken] One, two..[flash goes off] Didn't say three, did I?
We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg!  Jim leave us.
I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please...
Yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
There are very few things that would make me not want to team up with David Wallace. And Suck It is one of 'em.
They are not.  Yes, they are. [Jan hangs up]  That's my girlfriend.
Oh, please, stop talking. Three words or less.
...Wait, Ryan said that?
Do you feel it?
Just one joke.  Ok.  Well, if it's just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke.  Umm... let's see... choo choo choo.
Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.
Oh, cr..., oh, God.  Meredith, you know what?  I just need a minute, okay?
[coming out of his office] Lampshade on head! It's happening!
Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.
Ok. I love it. I love it.
I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.
Do you? I don't think you do. Devon was one of my best buddies. And now he hates me.
Don't try to flirt your way into this. Sometimes you really creep me out.
Oh!
It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day.
It worked.
Oka--
Daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you.
And we are prepared to reject that offer.
What?
Okay.
[knock on door] Mmm-hmm.
Chili's is great.
No you would not.
I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.
Stanley Hudson, you are fired.
Yeah I'm fine. Look, about you and Jim.
Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline! [to Chad Lite] Did you get all that?
Here's my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good.
No, I'm gonna have the gourmet hot dog.
Talk to you later-- [Jim hangs up] Okay, you didn't let me say good-bye. [sighs, and claps hands once] Alright, I am looking forward to this.
It's all connected. Shut up. [to A.J.] Does she ever mention 'Michael Scott?'
Yeah.
Curly? Very good. Curly Joe DeRita.
No, you're the best person for the job.  You're going to be great.
You and me.
Just tell me it is going to be okay, all right?
Just pay for it and we'll reimburse you when you get back.
Work it out amongst your selves!
[under his breath] I work with a bunch of nerds.
Fine! [everybody stops talking] Have your party. Just no guests.
That's not true. [Pam stares him down] You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.
What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point.
Forty... I'm in my forties.
I will seduce her.
Oh. It's a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.
Eh.
Yeah. [laughs] Wow. I just miss you so much.
You know what's even more offensive, is baling on this party because some...  jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here's my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room.
Maxim? American Way? Cracked?
Espresso?
Okay. [Jan leaves Michael's office; Dwight enters]
I really, I don't want to get panty liners, please...
Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning.
Pam and Jim's wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe.
What?
I did not order a stripper.
[whispers] Okay.
Good luck. One of a kind.
[comes over to hug them both] My girls.  There they are. [Pam walks away]
That's not true.
Jim, it's not the horniness, ok it's the loneliness that...
Are you done? ...Good. Okay.
Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?
No, seriously.
She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.
Are we all set?
Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring.
Hmmm. Ha. [under his breath] Alright. Great.
I think you should do that. [Kelly starts fake-crying, then laughing, then she and Michael both laugh]
You work in paper long enough, you get to know the players. [dials phone]
He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man.
Okay, Ryan.
Erin, can you give us a second?
I don't need to cheat.
Guys, she's in there.
OK.
That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way.
Coulda sworn there was...
No it is- don't! I'm not gonna bump. I'm not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying. [Stanley laughs]
Phyllis?  Could you take-.
Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say.
Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.
You saw who did this and you didn't stop them?
Hey, Stanley. I don't tell you how to do your job, do I? He...
Yes she does. Yes she does. We're all gonna go and we're gonna have a good time. [hugs Angela]
Darryl?! Hey. Hi. Where's Darryl?
Yeah?
Ah.
And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice.  Something that Dwight doesn't like.
500 and one penny. One million dollar!
Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?
And you guys are okay with this?
No. [tries to hide piece of paper, but Pam grabs it]
It is?
It's just... brrrrrr... It's 'Amazing Race,' Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it.
Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else.
All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there. [Looks at  Dwight] Let's go.
Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. I'll explain, later.
[to Jim] Who's there?
I know, I know. Crazy world. Crazy, crazy world.
Congratulations.
Of course.
I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..
I...
13 hot dogs, everybody!
Really? How did-- how are you inspired?  How did it pop into your head Dwight?
What did you think was going to happen?
Well, it's not ideal but you have to give me some credit 'cause I made it into a word.
Yes, right in here, come on in.
You broke up with AJ weeks ago.
We have been friends forever, right?
I was never given a name. [hangs up, he and Dwight sigh in relief]
I...
Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass.
[watching Dwight eat breakfast] How can you eat like that?
Okay
I would love to take them all to Jamaica, but is that good management? Yes. But is it the best management? Well, I can't afford it, and corporate won't pay for it. So who's the real criminal?
Really.
Good night Vikram.
Umm... I don't know? Average kind?
...was that he was a complete stupid idiot.
How?
No, I have plenty of friends, so... all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show.
Yeah, she does all that.
You would have done the same. You just didn't think of it first.
It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.
You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real. [blindfolds eyes with tie] OK.
Oh... God... [stomps] God! [throws hockey stick and yellow paper bracelet down] We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna... come here [hugs Kevin].
Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna...
Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock.  And when I came to, I had an epiphery.  Life is precious.  And if I die I want my son to know the dealio.  The dealio of life.
Wow!  What happened in there?
You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.
You can do this.  You can do this.
Absolutely.
I have a job.
Well, I call it fun!
[Michael answers phone] Yeah.
[accent] I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Y'all skedaddled way too soon.  We need to reopen this case.
Why do I like Hooters? Well I will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings.
Okay! Okay!
Well, that's a relief. Santa's gonna take some much-needed free time. Alright. Good!
No, no, no, NO, no!  You know what?  Fat people are not monsters!  Why don't you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject.  Bang!  Boom!  Case in point!  Look at the outside of this building.  It is ugly.  But you come inside... and it is beautiful.  Just like this unappealing fat suit.  Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man.
Oh, here we go!
It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers. [DeAngelo jogs up and takes the Dundie and tries to go back to his seat]
Pfffffttt.
She would have definitely slept with me.
