[kisses her and speaks normally again] You ahh.
I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.
As you can smell there's a lot of different odors going on in here.
[coming out from his office] Hello, may I help you?
Excellent! Way to go! Nice! [Michael and granddaughter Prince exchange high fives]
OK, well I know. You told me that several times.
And I used to say 'Hey, got latte?' And she'd say, that's not funny.
And I was about to take her bra off...
I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol.
Ahhhhhh! [laughs] Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?
It's enormous, but it's got wheels.  We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell.  Get the car ready, keep the engine running.
No seriously.  You should have an M&M, they're really good.
I was going to be a bottle capper.
Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or...
Still don't know who I am? I'll give you a hint. I go over other people's heads.
I don't think our company actually needs any more insurance. So I am out.
Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?
Oh, yuck!  TMI!  How was it?  I don't want to know.  Tell me later.  Let's go!  Let's go!  Hospital!
Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I'm the conductor. [blows into whistle] But I'm sort of the conductor of the office here, right? [blows into whistle] You want to try?
Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'.
Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I'm completely overwhelmed.
Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, I've heard women and children first. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully. And, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands.
Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.
What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting.
[smoking a cigar]  Yeah, that's right.  It's a baby, see?
I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn't come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. I'm startin' to feel it a little bit. Ohh... It's Creed's birthday. [singing] Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday, buddy.
Shhh. No, you can't have it.  It's too late.
Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules.
Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos.
Probably the best one that we have ever had, right? [cheers and applause] But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter.
OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts. [Dwight comes back with set of knives] Hey, what...
No, no! It's not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up. They're a great audience.
No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy.
Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna...
No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?
Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too!
Really? Here we go! Buckle up. It's going to be a bumpy one!
Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop.
Let's get down to business.  Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.
No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long. [Michael starts playing with a football in the office] Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh! [laughs] Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted.
Nah. [everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away.
Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.
No. No. I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.
You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going?
Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . .
It's okay guys... I can handle this.  Everybody can go home.
That is the way you're supposed to do it, idiot.
...all fixtures included. Yes, this is... This is looking good.
Okay, great. Fine. Well, then, if anyone is annoyed later at what goes down, you know who to blame. Stanley. Not the guy who was trying to be creative. [turns around to find Toby standing behind him]
Hey, Schneider, real quick. What do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff?
Oh no, no, no. You don't have to do that. I've got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet.
When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer Holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire.
[walks back into office with Jan] Okay. [clears throat] Jan, we need to talk. [Jan turns revealing that she has had her breasts enlarged]
I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight. [hangs up] Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did I...and the only reason I got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in.
A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores? [makes a noise and gestures with his hands]
How about July 4th weekend? [Reveals paper ticket]
... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, that's good timing. That's... that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible... terrible news for both of us [takes cake into office and slams the door].
Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, 'Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I...
You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That's the best thing? Really? Ugh.
If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia it is a liar. I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars. Bury them in my yard. And I wouldn't tell the cops a thing. Not that I would be lying per se. But I would just get really quiet, all of a sudden.
Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.
Mo money mo problems, Stanley.  You of all people should know that.  Let me ask you this, if I were-
[entering Dunder Mifflin offices] Here we go! Are you ready?
Okay. Like he's going to win anyway, right? [laughs]
No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said?
Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.
Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything.
Ahaha, Yep! [Dwight looks down depressingly and rubs his new goatee]
[after Phyllis leaves suddenly] What is she so upset about?
[on phone] Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks.
So think about it.  Lets put a pin in it for now.
No, no, no.  I'm looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune.
[walks into park with Dwight] Hi stranger! Long time!
Uh, because you've been on the Lam? Because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?
I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.
W-I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious... I'd wear two condoms.
[leaving a message] Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. [Jan walks in] OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later.
Lets try a little... Little social experiment here. Raise your hands if you like to buy things. OK, I see some people who like to buy things. You're it, you are the reason this world rolls along, give yourselves a round of applause. Say, say you want to start a business, and business is all about buying and selling, is it not? So say you want to sell lemonade, or stickers. Something you have to keep in mind, you must, and you might want to jot this down, you must sell the stickers for more than you bought the stickers for.
Ok. 'Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.'
Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.
Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we're gonna be talking... about...PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!
Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be.. [muttering, people rise to leave] No, no, meeting's not over.
I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.
You know what?  This young man needs to learn that's not how you treat people.  I don't care if it's pizza.  Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through.  You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you?  Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room.  Right now, get in the conference room.
Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there.
Yeah, that Gould is a real interesting guy, a gem. I can see why he and Jan are no longer together. If my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship, he was verbally abusive, he was curt. He was... He had an inability to communicate, shall I say? He was emotionally unavailable. I don't know how she dealt with that as long as she did.
I want it to embarrass all other parties.  I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, 'Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?'
[in video] I am so scared... when people don't label their personal food.
Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?
You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?
Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody.
[board of directors has started to exit] Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen. We'll be back with some answers. [a few murmurs from the crowd of 'What answers?'] I - ok. I know that you're mad at me and you're mad at all them -
Does anybody have anything?  Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?
[turns to the fake head, listening] What? There was someone left off that list? Who?
It's not amazing... at all.  It's sort of weird that I went and did that.  And now your wish won't come true, so that blows.
[watching Dwight eat breakfast] How can you eat like that?
I met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each other's vibe. I was totally grooving on him and vice-versa. And besides, the last two people to have his job were Jan and Ryan. The former was my lover, and the latter my best friend. So, who knows? I do. [in British cockney accent] It's gonna be mental! It's going to be mental.
I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.
I'm trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis' wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes.  Which won't be hard, because it's going to be awesome.  A lot better than hers, that's for sure.  It'll probably be on a boat.
You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret.
[to Holly] Well that's a... pretty good reaction. [Holly nods] Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?
I guess you said something weird about your daughter?
And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so...
Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.
[bending Luke over desk, spanking him repeatedly] You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!
[sees Holly behind Jan] I was just going to...  I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene.  She smells like old tomatoes and dirt.
This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?
Yes they are, you just don't care about the information.
I've dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.
Four! [Holds dice in front of Carol] Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites. [Holds dice in front of Jan] All right, here we go!
[in a fat suit, speaking in his Michael Clump voice] Ohhhh!  Bang!  Boom!  Say Clump! Why hello everybody!
You know what, we don't have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps.
I gave it to you in the car.
Oh, oooh his mistress.  No. I'm kidding.  No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.
Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm.
Um, nothing. I just... I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you. [leaves office]
Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time.
Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party.
You are gonna get seasick if you keep reading in here.
Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I'd love to be a part of one someday.
Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?
[playing Jan's message] 'I guess I missed you.' I guess I missed you.  So, she misses me?
I can just continue to run it myself.
Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?
Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.
Feelin'... feelin' hot, hot, hot! [plays conch shell]
Tell them what you told me. This is genius.
Just one joke.  Ok.  Well, if it's just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke.  Umm... let's see... choo choo choo.
I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.
No.  I had a fish stick sandwich.  Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches.  My girlfriend didn't want hers.  Because I guess I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs.
The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.
No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score.
Yes.  Yes!  Oh!  There-oh! [Clutches chest and falls to the floor]
Yes. What? Oh, yeah, have Pam give those to me.
Daaah, let's just run away together.  Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would... be fine.  We'd have fun.
Oh, man.  That was really good.  That was really good.
Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I've ever met.
I'm comin' atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him.
No, I only answer to Detective Wallace 'cause I got a warm body in the other room.
That's unfortunate.  How 'bout the suggestion box?  There's tons of ideas in there.
I... Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it.
I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin.  I was thinking we could name the company something like, 'Paper Great.  Where great paper is our passion.  We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!'  I don't know, could be good.  Or, uh, 'Super Duper Paper.  It's super duper.'  I don't know, something like that.
Dwight!? Great goin'. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh.
[in the bathroom] DeAngelo, what are you doing? There's a live audience out there!
Ryan's about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one.
Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.
I learned a lot about women today.  And any man who says he totally understands women is a fool.  Because they are un-understandable.  Jan and I broke up. Why?  Because she didn't like one message I left on her voicemail?  But that is her peariagative.  I thought I understood women, but maybe, can't believe I'm gonna say this, maybe, women don't understand themselves.
Pam, I'd like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day.
Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.
You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don't break the branches, Dwight.
I don't know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.
Good, stand up. [Kevin does so] You will be thin. You Won't drool over pizza like an animal anymore.
Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger.
Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I?
I, I surely do, and don't call me honey. [Jo laughs] You were playing too.
I... you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica.
Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!
You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
No, it will not be. I am on top of it.
Hello.  Oh, good for you.  I worry about you.
Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?
Don't. Please don't say anything. [sighs] Oh, God.
Nothing.  I wrote 'bringing someone to the hospital'.
Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!
Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay... you're a jackass.  [to Pam]  Hey, hey, you know what?  You're just as stubborn as your mother, when you don't wanna do something you just don't do it.
Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
See, this is a beautiful piece of material [rips other pant leg in half] This could be used for all sorts of things.
I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. [whispers] Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.
Yeah, but I destroyed it, it's not even useable anymore.
Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith.  But that is what you do when things die.  You honor them.  Toby killed this bird.  And now we are going to honor it.
Hey Jim, Jim. Come here. [holds up photo] Do you know who that is?
This is Pam Beesly, representing our girl next door.  Pretty but nothing special.  You know, but she sort of keeps it real. What you might want to do, is if you could zoom in, like really quick zooms on her. Might be good.  [walking away]  Who else? [pointing] Oh, Creed... is the old guy over there. Don't look at him. You might want to use him to sort of get that Orville Redenbacher dynamic going.
Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake.
Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn't have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner.
Oh-okay, you're not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars.
Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don't-[sees Kevin and Gabe fist-bump] Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?
I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it.
Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity.
That makes sense because he has elfish features.
Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance. [walks back to Ryan] Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?
Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box. [to Jan] That happens occasionally.
Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
Okay. They got sports medicine seminar, nope. Science fiction convention, nope.
Thank you. You, too. [steals a bottle of wine from the bar]
NEVER! [tosses wig] Okay, you know what? Fine.  I'm not Darryl. And thank God I'm not Darryl.
Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
[as Pam gives the thumbs up]  That sounds good!  Do you need some music, or...?  Okay.
I don't know if I can do that.  I can't see myself spending the next six years digging myself out of that kind of hole.
Good work. I'm proud of you. [Pam and Oscar leave] Mother-
Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby.
Okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry this guy's a temp and I should've told you that.
You know what? You're just lucky that we are at work right now.
Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.
That was Packer!  Oh, you're... you are dead.  You are dead, my friend!  That is hilar... Oh, God!  Of course it was you.
Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again.
We're never going to find those leads, are we? [they both sit on the edge of a claw-footed bathtub]
I'll get some punch. That looks delicious. [shoves Santa hat into punch]
Good stuff.  All right.   Let's get down to some wine drinking.
Oh, no problem. [looks down] And he signed!  He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately.
Oh, hey. No, I'm not busy. What's up?
You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems don't matter to him, because we're just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face. [looks towards the sky] I'm okay. No, I'm not.
You know what?  I would love a slice of real New York style pizza.
I opened a big can of whoop-ass on him.
You really don't get it, do you?  You don't understand these people.  That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.
And another thing about the Indian people... they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before?
Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?
Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales.
Case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I don't wannna get my head stepped on.
[walks back in, on cell phone] What? Oh my God!  [everyone starts asking questions]  There has been a murder.  There's been a murder in Savannah. [runs back to his office]
Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Let's go.
Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.
Do it! Do it!  Scream!  Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out.
What difference does it make whether your here?
Hey. Where's my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I don't know where she is. 'Cause I'm drunk, I can't even find her.
I know.  I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me.  You've been my most trusted ally.
I just want Phyllis to have a great day.
I can give you more money-there's your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-there's your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?
I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is... [puts paper on glass and makes a copy, then takes paper from glass] working perfectly.
Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.
Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.
I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that?
You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.
The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didn't just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on.
Okay. Well...get ready, 'cause it's gonna get better.
Oh, wow.  That sounds hilarious.  I do actually. [pulls whoopee cushion out of pocket and hands it to them]  There you go.  Use it in good health.
Behold! [extends his arms] Jesus Christ. And I bring to you glad Christmas tidings. I want to remind everyone the true meaning of Christmas. [Angela claps] Those of you who wish to join me, that's great. I'm excited by that. And those of you who don't, I forgive you. But I never forget.
[yells] THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! [Jan gets an evil look on her face and picks up Michael's dundie and throws it into his plasma screen tv] THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe! [Jan goes upstairs crying.]
You just said 'part of your duties are to' something.
Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.
There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.
She's dead? [Dwight makes knife slitting noise] She's so young.
I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So... so it's not the same thing. At all.
Oh! [rips open cardboard box] Wow. Awesome. [distributing items] For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has Creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you.
This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it!
Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.
So, umm... thanks for coming by. So, I, uh...
I will give you a number of reasons why it is, actually. Okay, first, incest is bad. Racism is bad. No brainer, right? Two, incest. We're all a family, right? We're all brothers and sisters. Racial message? Um? Number three, and this is a fact. The states where they have a lot of racism are the states where they have a lot of incest. Okay? And finally...
[cutting him off] Okay, okay. You know what, I didn't actually lose my keys...
So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun?  That must have been fun.
[accent] Whoa. What's this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son?  This here's Savannah.
Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.
[staring at birthday card] Meredith, Meredith... Meri... Mary had a little lamb. Mary... Meredith had a little lamb. Don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor.
You have no idea how high I can fly.
Is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust?
Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride? [Meredith drops her top. Michael takes a picture] All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?
I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard.
Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here.
Yes we should. I... you know what?  I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage, [turns to Kevin] someone had eaten all of them.
I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin.
Uh huh. [gestures to Kevin to keep it quiet] Alright?
Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!
Fine. If you are so anxious to see a head roll, it's you. There. You brought it on yourself. Too bad. Can't say that I'm sorry. It's a relief.
Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door. [Dwight runs out of the office]
That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way.
And if not we can just make him disappear. [walks quickly over to Jim's desk] This is Jim! Halpert. Jim has a very expressive face, don't you Jim? He is like our Mr. Bean.
Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.
[clears throat] So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this...
Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.
All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks.
Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night?
So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus.
OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr...
I'm thrilled with the work they've done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around.
No, no, no, no.  We don't do that.  We don't do that.
Can't I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape?
Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight.
Oh. [doves move across cord] What the hell is that?
Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.
I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
Hey, you embarrassed my friends in front of me and I'm gonna need you to go back over to the table and apologize.
Leader... ship. The word 'ship' is hidden inside the word 'leadership,' as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork!
Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.
We heard what you said. You didn't cover it at all.
Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head.
Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it.
Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, I'm - God, I'm so mad! [on phone] This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we don't want to work. No we don't! It's not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! We're not going to do it! [hangs up] Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday.
It's really amazing. Congratulations Karen. So is there a guy or, uh, a person. Or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or?
I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule: Just do it. Nike.
[knock at the door] Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?
Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow. [pulls out an envelope from his jacket]
Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend.
Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool.
Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for.
Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?  It's... pssssh... .  He was almost 70.  Circle of life.
[clears throat] Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they're living together, they're having lots of consentual sex--
Why are surveys important? Okay, hypothetical: A man wants to buy 500 reams of....carrots. And, so he's like 'What do I do? Where do I go? Do I go to the insensitive carrot supplier, the insensitive carrot salesman? Or do I go to the nice carrot salesman, who will maybe charge a few cents more per ream of carrot, but guarantee next-day delivery on your carrots? Most companies need their carrots the next day. Now, substitute paper for carrots, and that is why surveys are important.'
Ugh, forget it.  I'll just get up myself.  No!  Uh, aaaahhh!  Ah!  Oh God!
And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.
Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names.
Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.
You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it,
Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?
Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.
Well, [whispering] Hey Pam, did you get that down?
Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.
I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm.
Newsflash:  I've been here for fifteen years. Headline:  You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story!
Hug it out, bitch.  That is what men say to each other, after a fight.  They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go.  And walk away.  And they're done.  Not a good idea to say that to a woman however.  I have found.  It doesn't translate.
This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness. [points at wall] Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.
Fine! [everybody stops talking] Have your party. Just no guests.
Wow, thirty years? And you two only met once before the wedding night?
I'm not really sick. [Meredith takes a lick and hands back to Michael] Nah, I'm good.
There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie! [Dwight plays a celebratory honking noise on his keyboard]
What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?
She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?
[Michael, Ryan and Pam sitting at restaurant, phone rings] Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?
Well, [points at himself] busier. Making the time.
You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him.
No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway.
Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan.
All right everybody. I'm out of here. Jim, you're in charge.
Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I don't know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a
Can I have everyone's attention please?  Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who's supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question?  Do you all know what it's like to be disabled?  Oscar?
You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.
Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't.
I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here.
You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop. [closes door] You are a good salesman. And because of that...I want you to work for me.
Wha - No. No. Not even close. I can't force you to go down but I can entice you. I'm gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.
I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please...
Hello, Dwight. What's with the shirt? Are you alright?
Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing.
Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef. [points to chef] Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak. [leans over to neighboring man's plate] I see steak.
[clears throat] Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!
I'm great! I saw your-your sign outside. And I decided, I'm going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her.
It's the best.  It's the best.  I would not miss it for the world.  But if something else came up, I would definitely not go.
No!  I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything.  You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales.  So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?
Well, I don't really have two heads. So...
We're all gonna have a good time tonight!
I  love Halloween. You know, it's just, it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson's boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year.
You're just a bunch of voyeurs.  Are you eating popcorn?
Honey and jelly sandwich time. [removes lunch from fridge]
I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van.
Everyone wants the iPod. It's a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.
And we are going to straighten this out.
Lynn, follow me, come on in.  For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone.  Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.
You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.
Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-
Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you.
I don't know what the [expletive] that was.
Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good.
Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good. [Holly's smile quickly fades] Because I am busy taking you out.
Actually, it's Valentine's Day. Shouldn't be doing this today. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
[turns to other restaurant patrons] I'll have what she's having!
Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.
[English accent] Oh, sorry, mate. Excuse me. Mate.
Well, it's, like, well, it's, you know, when refine it, refine a character down to its essence,  that's...
God, Stanley, that's frickin' brilliant. How do you know that?  Did you learn that on the streets?  Sorry.
Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.
No. That's not cool. You don't have to tell them.
Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff? [several seconds of silence]
What? No, I didn't want to make everybody nervous.
Because I loves to party and I'm gonna be partying my butt out at this place.
Hey. Who wants to watch Michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he's bringing it over.
Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you. [walks out] SO SUCK ON THAT!
Uh, [in a nerdy voice] 'I'll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword.'
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And at the end I will reveal, that they were all just one rule.
Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I'm a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years.
Nope, nope.  I actually wear a turban sometimes.  Wanna see it?
[carrying the car seat] Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office: Assst...
No! Okay. [runs out the door] All right.
I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.
Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.
I think you're great.  You're my best friend.
[talking over Toby and Katy] Toby's divorced. God, that's hard. That really ripped you up. She got the kids right? That'll damage ya. Sorry man. That's uh, that's a bad one. How much you paying her? What can, you can't even afford anything now, right? You're all right though, right? Don't ask me for a raise. [laughs] Cup of Soup's a good idea though. That'll... that's a good budgetary thing to do.
Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party?
[whispers to Meredith] I'll be down in a minute. [walks over to Toby] Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?
This is not a game, this is my life.  You are out of order, sir.
Oh. Well, in my office, if you took off your shoes, it would be a sign of disrespect. Stinkyfeetville. Kind of a ying-yang. [exclaiming] Oh, stretchin'. I like to stay tight. Compact. [Dwight screaming]
Okay, Pam... she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions.
[voice breaking] Yeah, well, at least he was married.
No, that was- I'm just getting into the first act.
Yes? [Pam holds up a bag] Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that.
With dissatisfied clients, it doesn't matter what you did. All they wanna hear is that you're sorry. They're like women that way. And this client is a woman. So when I say I'm sorry, it will be twice as effective.
Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled!  Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let's get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.
Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the 'bucks.
Alright stop, stop making him say it!  You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.
I mean I just don't want to have to tell them something they're not going to want to hear.
Cool. What next? [Dwight puts his face on scanner]
And this next award is going out to our own little Pam Beesley...
[walks over to Erin's desk] Hi, Erin. Happy Secretary's Day.
Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?
[rapping] I'm MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. She's DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat!
Wow, I don't want to hear... you talk.  Pam, could I have a word with you in my office?  [stumbling] Oh, oh, oh.  Alright.
Hello.  I've seen you guys around.  I'm Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin.   How you doing?  [they stare at him] Uhghh, so I guess you know why I'm here?  I need to purchase something.
No. I haven't finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? That's it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybody's getting their chance.
Business has been pretty crazy around the office.
Was I?  Really? Was I saying anything interesting?
[heard yelling from the street] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!
OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?
I am about to give blood.  The gift of everlasting life, the transfer of my bodily fluids, oh wow, that's a big needle, that --
Well, you know what? You're right, Phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That's the problem.
Jim it's okay. You can t... [Jim looks at Pam and shakes his head, Pam looks at him and gestures for Jim to go up and tell his story] This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. [Jim shakes his head no] It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. [Jim stands up] Oh, he's doing it, okay. [Jim looks at Pam] It's okay. [Jim pretends to try, looking teary eyed, shakes his head no, mouths 'I can't' and sits back down. Pam is amazed.] Oh. Okay, are you sure? [Jim shakes his head. Kevin pats his shoulder] That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. [Pam nods in admiration at Jim] Okay, well.
In nature, there is something called a food chain; it's where the shark eats a little shark. And the little shark eats a littler shark. And so on and so on. Until you get down to the single cell shark. So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.
We are in the heart of it. [Bathroom sounds rattle the small office.] And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.
An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley...
That's my white out. Get your own white out. Just... what's the matter with you? God. [Toby leaves] Okay, um, there was a girl from Dunder Mifflin. Who had a big, puttifflin. [thinking out loud] Mifflin, spifflin.
Ha! That-- I am not known for that!
[grunts] Your life. [sits down, upset] Oh, wow. Whew. Ahh, legs are sorta giving out. Long drive in the car, so let's just- We'll just continue. [sighs, falls to floor, gets more upset] Oh, wow. [takes deep breath] Ooh, okay.
[hides his face from Holly; whispers to Toby] I'll kill you.
It's uh... two and a half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone.
Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you're on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.
Once in a lifetime opportunity people! Come on, here we go!
Don't talk to me that way please. Just... they're going to want to hear this from you.
Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.
[Andy is playing with the tire iron] Take that thing off the table! Please!
Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.
Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes.
Daddy's here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
Enabler!  Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler.  It's Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.
You had a rough night tonight.  But your life is very good, my friend.  You've got a great job, you... you can have any woman you want, you're good looking, you, you know...
Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye... bye.
[hands Ryan a soda] There you are, my friend.
OK, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let's just...
That's funny! That's funny. Not offensive. Uh... because it's nature. Educational.
What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.
Tell him. Tell him that your supervisor is on the line.
[as Mikanos] I like the musical 'Grease', or as we call it, 'home'.
What, um... what do you think of role-play?
Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles... Damn it. Okay, sorry. Don't laugh; please don't laugh this time Dwight. You're... it's, it's bugging me. Let me give myself a countdown, ready? Three, two, one.
Okay, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?
How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator.
Yes, yes. What yes? A sale or a lead or...
And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well.
If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. [Sighs]
Well, well.  Holly... lujah!  It's a miracle, you're at your desk.
Don't - don't do that. That's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close.
I know.  I know.  It is beautiful.  No.  Thank you.  Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons?  You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up.  I think you need to get the lead out.  Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here.  We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower.  Well you know what, where's my golden shower, Phyllis?
Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.
If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure?  I'm sure whatever you did it wasn't your fault.  OK well, who else?
Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.
Happy to do it.  Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.
Did you know that gay used to mean happy?  When I was growing up it meant lame.  And now it means a man, who makes love... to other men.
It is the 'Whitest Sneakers' award! Because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on!
We could go back and forth all day. It's not gonna solve anything.
Oh, shoot! Okay. All right. All right. [throws up hands] Pull it over. Here we go.
Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?
Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.
I'm not changing that, it's the best one.
And this is, don't tell me, Martin... Ne... Ne...Nack.
Oh coffee, that's too much. [Dwight drinks it]
You win. But here's what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.
I honestly don't see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn't love his wife just because he's not sure what she looks like?
We tried and we failed.  Stanley, you may go.  Here is a box, for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place.  Fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free.  Pam, I'm gonna need some help writing a want ad.
This is Darryl Philbin. Isn't he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will 'do' you. [laughs] No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?
All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I'm going to cover for you. [shouts] All right!
OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?
Oh nonsense [lifts leg and puts it on Jim's desk], no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat.
Roy and Pam. It's a Ram. It's a Ram thing.
You ever read this? [holds up Green Eggs and Ham]
What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.
Am I the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?
Okay, Tuesday. Whenever. You'd better try it on, make sure it fits.
No.  You have to just push it out!
Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say.
I didn't get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible.
That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.
Okay, put her through. [Deep voice] Jan Levinson, I presume?
Whispering and tickling have their place in business.
[on his cell phone] Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.
No, you were not stupid.  Gould was stupid.  Right?
Yeah, well, that's just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don't have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together.
What, no.  No.  Okay, bags.  I have bags under my eyes, Pam.  I didn't see it at home, I didn't see it in the bathroom, I didn't see it on any of the city mirrors, but in this light...
Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?
And another thing I did this summer, I hired my nephew.
Alright.  I'm ready to go and I'm callin' shotgun.
[in the car] You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well.
Gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz. I just have a different life style. They have these bags of vegetables that steam right inside their own bag. So I'll get a few ingredients, sit down in front of the TV, a bag of vegetables, before you know it I'm ready for bed!
Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we're going to be doing separate checks.
Aaaall right. Who's next, who's next, who's next, who's? Jim? You're next. Who would you do?
Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today.
[sees 'Happy Birthday Michael Scott!' poster at skating rink] That should not be there.
No, no, no, no. We'll find some, don't leave the party.
[taps on desk and starts to leave his office] Do you want this open or closed?
This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.
Jim, you're in charge of the vacation schedule now.
The 'Spicy Curry' award goes to our very own Kelly Kapoor!  Get on up here. Here you go.
I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.
[doing situps] I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.
Good. Yes, that will work. All right. Now I need a plural noun. [All groaning]
...We don't want them back, 'cause they're... stupid.
He doesn't need to sit, he's a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.
[enters] [in a gruff voice] Hello, I am here for the small business seminar.
Oh, hey, hey, no, don't run. You're gonna slip.
I say, I say, I say, I say down Holly! I'll take it from here. I am beautiful. [hangs pictures of fat people on the wall, including two fat people on a bike, the Ghostbusters Marshmallow Man, Elvis, Martin Lawrence in Big Mamma's House, Jabba the Hutt, and a fat pig] They are beautiful. He is beautiful.  This big fat pig is beautiful.
What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.
[mouth full of brownie] Just stop it.  You haven't done anything helpful all day.
[video dialogue] And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants.  Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home. [video says, 'Great Scott!']
1,000 going once, 1,000 going twice. Sold for 1,000 dollar. [applause] Nicely done.
God, you look like such an idiot. [both yelling] [grunting]
Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?
No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die!  Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president!  You are black, Stanley! I'm gonna give him mouth to mouth.
How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive.
Before you got here, I'm the one who landed all these clients.  Half of them, at least. I can do it again.  I know the market, I know the price points.  I'm on it, don't worry.  So, how do I do that?
[on phone] Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica.
You're welcome. Whoa! [leans back] Almost fell. [they both laugh]
Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would've turned thirty. That's just - that's just depressing.
Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher.
Ignore him.  You know what?  We're not that different, you and I.  When I clamped my foot into a non-stick...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.
I put Stanley on a pedestal, for a long time.  But sometimes he can just be a big, fat jerk.  I... jerks don't deserve to be on pedestals.  Jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are.  Big marble... jerk stand.
[looks at Jim]   Permission to speak on the record?
You don't have to say it like that.
That was funny.  Let's go do it to somebody else.   Ayyyy!
I have a lot of big ideas, and the trick is to get it out of my brain and into theirs, in a way that is easy to swallow. Simple... [holds up snickers] Kids love candy bars.
Thank you very much. It is from Italy. [checks jacket] Actually--- no, Bulgaria.
You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy!
While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society.
Well, it's part of it, it's just the... uhhh.
This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?
Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.
This... You know this is a scale of one to ten?
The important thing is... this kept us secure people.
Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg. [Gets off bus] Watch out for snakes!
I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot.
Wow, that is... that time really adds up.  That's like... a half an hour, every hour?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Dwight, you're handsome.  You're a very handsome man, get in the car.
He... Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great.
No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in [making drum noise] Jamaica's largest fresh water pool.
Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times.
Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.
That is a lucky number. Seven. 7-Up. Seven dwarfs.
Exactly! Mmwwah [blows kiss to Angela]! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?
Untrue. The heart is bigger than the skin. If you stretched the heart out, it would cover more than the entire body.
Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-
Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company.
[entering break room, to Maurie] You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up.
No, no, no.  Dwight, let Jim do that, please.
So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?
I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.
I've never framed a man before, have you?
Darryl, [clears throat] have you ever been in a gang?
Nope, it won't be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke.
This isn't about me, and that is debatable.  And I have a personality, where as you...  Yes, Andy?
Well, that is probably from the test drive.
[on sidewalk] There it is! I saw it! I saw it! He went right by! You missed it! [all groan]
Um... find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?
--that none of us can be a part of--
But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model.
An electric car dealership. [Oscar gets up and starts leaving]
Pam, it's Michael.  I need you to go into my office and check some data for me.
I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.
Well, I can see Andy proposing to Angela. I can also see him proposing to Oscar. [they chuckle] Oh...
I've really learned from the greats. The great improvisers, Drew Carey, Ryan Stiles, uh, the Brady guy not so much. He's more the signing, Wayne Brady. Um, Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] 'Hi. I'm Mork from Ork.' Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo. [as Robin Williams] 'That's Good morning, Vietnam!' Well, hello to you. You know it would be... God. And you know what, sometimes when I'm watching somebody like um, like Jay Leno. He'll be half way through his step [snaps his fingers] And I will already be laughing at the punch line. He hasn't even gotten to it. He doesn't even know what it is it. So it's fun, you know it's fun having a mind that works like that. That is just a few steps ahead of... comedically ahead of like what's going on. Like I'll watch T.V. and I'll be watching a show and I will think, oh, I know someone's gonna walk in here right now and say something funny. And then they do. Or, um, I know they'll be like oh boy that person deserved to be slammed down. There's going to be some sort of insult. And there is. You know, there's like, 'Oh you're... God your butt is fat.' And I knew it. I know it's like I knew they were going to say that. I knew they were gonna go there. Don't go there. Um, but other... You know it's like uh, you know Leno, um and Letterman, Carson, you know. Need I say more? No.
Of course, of course. Yes. Yes. Look, I have a whole program planned. Jan, this program is going to change people's lives. I am going to be dropping serious knowledge all over the boat.
No, Rose. They are not breathing.  And they have no arms or legs.
Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.
You're welcome.  Missed you.  Missed you as part of our family.
Well, delivery is all wrong. She's butchering it.
Hey. Can you make that straighter? That's what she said.
OK, don't get that. Please? [Pam gets up to answer her phone]
Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And don't sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away.
Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today.
Jim.  Lots of e-mails to Amazon, lots of wasted computer space.  Alright, let's get back to work.
Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be?
Oh no no, I'm not picking on you at all. You're English, correct?
You know what, guys?  It's none of your concern.  It was official business, so just...
Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me.
No, I'm always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25.
Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion.  Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.
OK, press conference in 45.  Dwight, make sure this place looks nice.
You're...you know what?  I read in one of those books that you're not even supposed to give foot massages because it can induce labor.
When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn't even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So...
Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it.
Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It's a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It's not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper!
Uh, well, Jim and I got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning.
Who's doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and--
No, I have plenty of friends, so... all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show.
Well, I just got off the phone with Jan.  And um... she demoted me.
Oh. [She whispers in his ear. Michael starts to laugh] That's what she said.
We have a little song prepared for you.
Could I be a part of the meeting also?
[slurping] Oh, wow. How long have you worked here? How many years, Creed?
Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.
Guys, beef!  It's what's for dinner!  Who wants some man meat?
Remember on that animated special when they taught the uh, the monster to put the star on top? That's Dwight. Dwight's the monster that we taught to put the star on top of the tree. You take his teeth out, and he could put the star on top of the tree.
[on airplane] Welcome to Cribs-the business class edition. Check this out. Mimosa.
[cradling the car seat awkwardly] All right, OK.
Actually I think it's not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah! [takes remote, raises volume] There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord!
Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying.
It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier.
That's how devoted I am to this job.
No, no, no, no, wait. Final one, final one this is important. The more we can encourage interracial dating as a society the further away we get from incest, literally.
I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.
I need to say, 'What the hell is that? What the hell is that?'
Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right?
You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.
I can't believe I pushed that... that guy's lazy ass around all day... until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That's... well... I got news for you, Albert. If that's your real name. The show's not over.
Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party.
[in a stereotypical oriental accent] Herro everybodeeee. I'm gonna cwall Jan Revinson-Gould.
OK.  Oh, wait a second, wait a second, that's hers.   This is hers, she left her glove.  I need her name if I'm gonna return her glove.
Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute.  Guy had no sense of humor about it.  Probably why he wasn't hired.
This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her. [singing] I've got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we're leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um,  taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah.
We'll go.  I'm still recovering. So let's just, Ryan, could you get my coat please.
Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself.  You know, just a little bit of money.  Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times.  I don't know, kind of just for fun.  I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things.  Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something.  Like, who do I call about that?
Yeah baby! That's what I'm talking about. That could be you [points at Jim] if you hadn't forgotten French.  Where is my numbers man?
Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.
Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay...
I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.
I really thought these people were my friends. My best friend since kindergarten, Elliot, that's a friend. Best friend ever. I should call him. Wonder where he lives.
Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?
Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. [everyone raises their hand]
Hey, hey hey! Dwight. [Dwight rolls out an assortment knives]. Dwight.
It's done. [Oscar, sitting in the lobby, receives a text]
A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.
Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out.
Well, that's not the David Wallace that I remember. [reverses out of driveway, Wallace follows him] That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallace's house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here.
Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say they're going on sales calls and then go someplace else? 'Cause that's not cool.
You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,
Toby has written a fantastic speech for you, he spent a year on it.  It's very funny and charming and heartwarming.  And it rhymes, and if it's not any good, he has instructed us all to storm the stage and beat him to a bloody pulp.  [laughs] No!  So, take it away, Toby!  Whoo!
I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology.  The press wants a story, I will give them a story.
Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?
OK...  Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it'll fit, with all these little knickknacks.
You are so smart. You are so eff-in' smart. You should be teaching me.
Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.
Hey Hey, I don't go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!
Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged.
Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.
Okay, well, let's... . let's kind of take it a little slower.
Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing.
Just wanted to talk to you about  Jim Halpert.  I understand that he did not receive the promotion.  And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.
I've been trying. I've been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird.
So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third. [Knock at door] Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?
Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had sex with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didn't consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful.
I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?
And that. Is why. I need a smart intern.
I just, I fell in love with those kids.  and I didn't want to see them fall victim to the system, so I made them a promise.  I told them that if they graduated from high school, I would pay for their college education.  I've made some empty promises in my life, but hands down, that was the most generous.
No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic.
It's okay with me but he's gonna want me in there.
Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!
Yup. Ryan and I are just having some fun!
What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car.
Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.'
I'm just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever.
Oh... look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart.
You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend.
[making the mouth on his tie talk]  Yum! Yum yum yum! [Christian laughs]  That's delicious!  I love it!
You get to look at her.  Why don't you hold out your hand. [hands Brad paper] Tell me what you feel.
I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin.
You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World: Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see.
[standing outside hotel room... whispering] Do you want to get some breakfast or something?
Okay.  We are off.  Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers.
That's just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let's just...
I need your help.  This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.
No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work.
Okay, good-bye.  Wait!  Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?  Your best one?  [Karen hangs up]
You're just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what's going to be on your tombstone?  Loser.
Brought you some balloons. Why don't we... here you go. [wraps them around her IV] Tie these up, cheer up your tubes... [IV pops out] Oh! Shhhh... For God's sake!
Hey. [hugs AJ a little too forcefully] Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.
Well, he was getting a lot of applause, and I just didn't think it was indicative of how people were really feeling.
No! That is a toboggan, you never know when you're gonna find a snowy hill so... Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie.
[video dialogue for 'The Faces of Scranton'] Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we're not just in the paper business, we're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special. [video shows Stanley at desk] This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on.
Ha ha, you got that right!  Meredith?  Come on, you're obviously single.
Could I talk to you for a second?
Ok. Alright. We are gonna - we're gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We're gonna come back with a plan for you. It's a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track. [crowd starts to agree and perk up] 45 points. It's a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business. [crowd applauds] And you can take that to the bank. [applause continue] And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral. [crowd has gotten very excited and is cheering] I love you, New York! [Michael does the spin and leaves the stage - then runs back across the stage] You. You.
Three hours, wow.  Have fun.  [Dwight walks away staring through the blinds at Michael]
[imitating her accent] Well, I never thought I'd see your face around these parts, you old bastard.
Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up.
It's my sumo suit.  I just didn't inflate it all the way.  I am so glad that I bought instead of rented.
Yeah, way to go Phyllis. Nice work, per usual.
No, come on, Dwight, I have to have 10 of these by lunch, I promised Ryan.
I totally agree with you.  But I don't have money problems, I don't.  Alright, you know what?  Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this? [Michael holds up a bill, crumples it up, puts it back in his pocket]
I'm pretty good on politics. 'California is bankrupt, and California, California.' [Jim and Andy follow Michael into his office] What?
No, I didn't. [to Jan] Huh, what? [everyone looks up at blow-up doll]
I don't... Let's just not talk about it, okay?
[follows Jim into bathroom] You have to agree with me. [follows Jim back out] That's insane.
No, I can't talk to her. I can't even look at her without thinking about it ending.
Do a poem for Meredith's birthday or uh, limerick. Limerick. Um, [knock on  door] there was a girl from Dunder Mifflin. Come on in. Who had a big, smifflin.
You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money, she thinks I'm a human ATM machine.
Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then...
Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.
