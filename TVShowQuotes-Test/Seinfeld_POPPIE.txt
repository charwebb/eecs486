Ah, Jerry! Tonight you in for a real treat. I'm personnaly going to prepare the dinner for you and my Audrey.
So, I sell the restaurant, uh? I just take it easy. See, if I get excited, 'ats aggravated my condition. The last time I got aggravated, was in the restaurant. With your friend.
What's this? A bottle of wine and a five-alarm chili? They're trying to kill Poppie?!
That's not a pizza. It'll taste terrible.
