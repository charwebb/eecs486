(To cab driver) Pull over here driver this is it.
O.K. You take normal sips. Nothing wrong with that. Then what happened?
So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy the bra for Miss Mishke, would you say that was correct?
So you're driving in the car, you're with your friend, minding your own business?
So you're a victim. Now your face is shallow, unattractive, disgusting.
