This is my treasures, no they're my treasures!
Hey, new Jim, come sit on my face.
I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they���re the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You���re not alone sister. Let���s get a beer sometime.
Alright. [Andy opens back of her van, things fall out]
[runs away] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!  No! No!
[Sign says 'No Alcohol, No Loud Talking'] Um, What the hell?
Shut up and let me do this! [hangs up] You know, what is with this desk keeping us so far apart?
Hey, turn off the Chumbawamba and scram, twerp.
...when he was telling us his dumbass plan.
Toby, shut your hole about the empanadas. Nobody cares about the empanadas.
I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guy's fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing.
I don't care what everyone thinks.  I know I am not an alcoholic.
All right. [The four of them get out of chairs to run out, Jo exits her office. They retreat.]
Maybe we���re s���posed to do it with people in our group.
She's right. I had my second kid just for the vacation.
No, no, no, no. Just do your wok. Pretend mom���s not here.
No no no! You guys stay! No no no! I have Vienna Sausages and I have napkins. [walks into her house] Let me fix you breakfast!
[on the phone, while getting sprayed] Just take the casserole out of the- Take it out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven. It���ll be fine, just leave it in for 20 minutes.
[walking up behind the glass] Hey! What are you saying?!
Michael? You ran over me with your car. You posted a picture of my bare boobs on the bulletin board with a caption that said 'Gross'...
The deal is that this is my last hurrah, cause I made a New Year's resolution that I'm not going to drink anymore. During the week.
In five years, I'd like to be... five years sober.
These guys took me out on their fishing boat.  I don't think I caught anything.
Because Roy use to... [long censor beep]... with the rice... [long censor beep]... [laughs]
What do we get if we do 'em?
I'll smoke with you.  I got a bag of cigars in my purse.
I'll just have whatever's fanciest, unless there's ribs.  I'll just get the other information the day of, I'll text you.
Right. I got the bartender's phone number when you were in the john. I'm gonna take that freak to bone town before the night is over.
