Hey, how did it go?
No thanks. They're too sweet.
Yeah yeah, Princess Fancypants let Jane 12-pack over here take the fall.
Me. Please.
My car, my rules.
I'll go.  Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill?
I gotta go.
That was in your way?
Thanks Pam! I'll take a pack of Nicorette gum and a pack of Kools.
Forget you.
I don't want to say it out loud.
I don't care what everyone thinks.  I know I am not an alcoholic.
Hey remember that week in the 90���s when we got bagels?
Niagara Falls in October?  Pfft, hells yeah.
[stands up and reaches for her buttons] Okey-dokey.
See you guys at Poor Richard���s, all right?
Let her stay another hour. Let's go get a beer.
Nice job.
No way!  No way!  There is no way!
Anyway, I have this Sharpie...
No I'm not, I'm gonna sell it on Ebay! No no no, you be careful. Be careful.
[still laughing] I know.
Please don't tell a sailor joke.
What, is it on backwards? [partially removes wig, revealing her bald head]
Hi. I'm Meredith and I'm an alch... good at supplier relations.
What the hell?! [everyone complaining at Jim]
[comes out of the bathroom... screams... runs back into the bathroom]
The weekend!
Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. Flesh hoover?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait! Just wait!
Why don't we talk more about it instead of doing it?
Nothing.
What do you mean?
Pam said you had something important to tell me. Is it bad? Am I getting fired? [Jim shakes head 'no'] Why aren't you telling me? It must be bad. They're taking away my kid. I knew it. [Jim waves arms and shakes head 'no'] They're not taking away my kid. Oh.
It's no problem. You live right near me.
What else?
I don't want to!
No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers.
Hi, Pam.
What do we get if we do 'em?
Is that a threat?
Um... what about office romance?
Baking a cake, what does it look like I'm doing? Getting rid of the lice.
You weren't even in the room!  Thanks for nothing.
You comin'?
Do it!
Ow! Take it easy.
Three hundred and five.
Tell us!
I got some in my minivan somewhere.
Well, it must have just opened up.
Four and a half.
I'm not sorry about it.
Okay. If you change your mind, you just let me know, okay?
Talk about vacation days!
Come on, give it a rest pencil dick.
Oh, I'm sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl.
Nurse!  I just need some water.  And my pills.  Thank you.
You're right. You're right. Yes.
Hey, champagne.
[talking to Robert] Honestly, Jim gives me the creeps.
[walking up behind the glass] Hey! What are you saying?!
Get over yourself.
I'm getting fired, aren't I?  I can't get fired.  I got nothing else.  Nothing.  No skill set.  Can't type, bad on the phone, not great with people.
