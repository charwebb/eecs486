Thank you.
Because I was there. [shows Kelly her cell phone video] Your the people's princess! Diana was nothing!
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!
Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl.
Me.
You can take my van!
When are you gonna boom me?
And it looks like you're taking a dump.
Yeah, my neighbor got murdered.
Yes.
Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting-
What are you smiling for? You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
I would never do that.  Waste of money.  In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.
Turn around.
Shh. It's on.
How am I supposed to know what that is?
I call loser!
Sincerely, disappointed? Get off your high horse, Richie.
No, I get it.
I don't remember.
I'm getting fired, aren't I?  I can't get fired.  I got nothing else.  Nothing.  No skill set.  Can't type, bad on the phone, not great with people.
Hell no. She wishes.
Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
...The Fort, Andy Gavin's.
Yeah.
Looks good.
Stanley, didn't she say a bunch of racist stuff to you?
You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like. [Jim smiles]
What?
Oh my!
Is there anybody else.
Right. I got the bartender's phone number when you were in the john. I'm gonna take that freak to bone town before the night is over.
Suck it Oscar.
Nope. Nuh -uh. Not today!
[under her breath] get a divorce...get a divorce...
Crap. Sorry, Nellie.
No! No! No! There is no way! There is no way!
[raises hand] I want to.
Pam failed art school.
[as all agree] OK.
Man, he���s really in twinkle town now.
No! No! No! No! No!
I am not an alcoholic!
Pull over! Pull over! [Meredith uses a bush while all the other passengers look the other way, except Creed]
I have a shirt like that in my car.
Hey, champagne.
Liaisons, you mean meet-ups?  I don't know, once a month for six years.  Something like that.
I'm still recovering from last night. But maybe.
Well it's funny.  Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what's going on here?  I thought I had immunity?
She's right. I had my second kid just for the vacation.
Come on, how did you propose? Spill it. Were you wasted?
They make these cakes, they're wild! I mean, they show everything!
[holds out flask] Do you want a little?
You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three.
[walking in] Hey guys! [Angela leaves the table, exhales as she exits the room]
Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned?
Toby, shut your hole about the empanadas. Nobody cares about the empanadas.
That was in your way?
I am a very private person. I show 'em when I wanna show 'em. Who wants a taste? [lifts shirt to flash camera] Boob sauce!
Really?
Shut it, Angela.
No.  Something I can blackmail her with.
That's a great set of shoulder's you got there. What is that...Genetics? Creatine? [phone rings] Sorry. Yeah?
Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny penis. Are you happy? [sarcastically] Let's hire that guy! [Jim looks speechless]
