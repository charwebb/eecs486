Hey, how did it go?
You're not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct...
I don't know.  I saw a crowd.  I thought there might be a dogfight or something--
[Scoffs] We're out there sweating our balls off every day, bustin' our balls. We deserve a Christmas party!
Don't pull any plugs.
Hey!
Just relax. Okay.
She is an amazing actress.
Please don't tell a sailor joke.
Hi, Pam.
[walking up behind the glass] Hey! What are you saying?!
You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said.
Who's the one who didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam.
Better.
Yeah, let's get some booze and some cocaine and just blow it out. No consequences.
Oh I'm excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt [lifts up shirt, definitely
She hasn't popped yet.
Looks good.
Well I just hate being treated like some bum with no class. I'm a lady. I'm a mother. I'm a former boxer!
I'll take the oven mitt.
Almost. [she unlocks Holly's car]
Seven grand?
Don���t dog catch me!
[walks in conference room] Shaboom! How do you like me now!?
Fine, just give it.
She's gonna hate being a mom.
Take a picture. It will last longer.
Michael? You ran over me with your car. You posted a picture of my bare boobs on the bulletin board with a caption that said 'Gross'...
Thank you!
Well I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet.
What, is it on backwards? [partially removes wig, revealing her bald head]
Hey! No way!
Oh, God. Oh, no. I have this problem all the time. I never remember people I've had sex with.
[reading the game box cover] Belles, Bourbon and Bullets, a murder mystery dinner party game.
Whoa, whoa.  Wait a minute.  What is the etiquette on taking the gifts?  Can you only take your own back or is it a whatever you can carry type of thing?
If I ever get that bad, you���d tell me, right?
Maybe we���re s���posed to do it with people in our group.
I am not an alcoholic!
[seeing Michael drink from wine bottle] Michael! [bottle gets passed around by Darryl, Meredith and Kevin]
Seen and banged.
Good night.
Michael, I'm not gonna do that.
Am I in trouble here or something?
This is weird.
[as all agree] OK.
In five years, I'd like to be... five years sober.
[dancing drunkenly] Ahh yeah!!
Thanks. I wish I could've had it. Do you wanna trade?
Danny, I feel a real connection to you, and I gotta get real, I'm-
I'm getting fired, aren't I?  I can't get fired.  I got nothing else.  Nothing.  No skill set.  Can't type, bad on the phone, not great with people.
Yes.
Sincerely, disappointed? Get off your high horse, Richie.
I got permission to bring Jake into work, which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter.
Hey, new Jim, come sit on my face.
I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop.
What I said was, ���My sister's funeral is this weekend.��� Didn't say I'd be there.
[whispers] I'll read this when I get home.
Sure.
Wait, wait. She hasn't moved in awhile.
Well it's funny.  Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what's going on here?  I thought I had immunity?
Could you mean vagina? Because if you do, I want that covered.
What's it say?
Darryl!
She's got mean eyes.
