No, no, no, no. Just do your wok. Pretend mom���s not here.
Get up there and sing or I will cut your larynx and you'll never be able to sing again. Woo!
You're not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct...
I thought you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding.
These guys took me out on their fishing boat.  I don't think I caught anything.
A few months, that's why they're rushing the wedding.
Hey, what do you want? I know who I am. Nobody's taken Meredith Palmer to the opera to meet the queen.
Why don't we talk more about it instead of doing it?
Why would I be worried? I'm not a drug user. I would never abuse my body like that. I mean, they are plenty of other ways to have fun. My body is 100% drug-free.
I'll help. [Meredith tears the wings off of a Cupid]  Now it's just a stupid baby.
[sitting at kitchen table with Darryl] Have a cookie, Kev.
I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is.
Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in?
Okay. One two three- [takes picture] Oh let's do it again. Pam your smile is weird.
Maybe we���re s���posed to do it with people in our group.
Hey, new Jim, come sit on my face.
Hey everybody, he's not in the men's room although the seat was warm so we may have just missed him.
Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. Flesh hoover?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's just a cold sore.
[shaving her own head] Yes, Pam what do you want?
Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car... for screwing Americans.
Let her stay another hour. Let's go get a beer.
Oh, 'cause you spent so much on the wedding.
Andy followed you home after the Christmas party.
What are you smiling for? You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
In five years, I'd like to be... five years sober.
This is my treasures, no they're my treasures!
Thanks. I know how to drive. [dumps the crumbs from a bag of chips she was eating into her mouth and throws it out the window]
