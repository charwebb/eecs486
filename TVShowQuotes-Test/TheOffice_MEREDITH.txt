I ask... everyone in the room, 'Are you in a relationship?'.
I don't care what everyone thinks.  I know I am not an alcoholic.
[Scoffs] We're out there sweating our balls off every day, bustin' our balls. We deserve a Christmas party!
Michael? You ran over me with your car. You posted a picture of my bare boobs on the bulletin board with a caption that said 'Gross'...

I've had two men fight over me before. Usually it's over which one gets to hold the camcorder.
[to Michael] We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip, your favorite.
Pull over! Pull over! [Meredith uses a bush while all the other passengers look the other way, except Creed]
I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.
[stares at the table filled with treats] Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty.
Wait. Kathy gets to go? Uh, why does she even still work here? Pam is back.

Stanley, didn't she say a bunch of racist stuff to you?
Nurse!  I just need some water.  And my pills.  Thank you.
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!
You're not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct...
[stands up and reaches for her buttons] Okey-dokey.
Hey, I was on the can. What���s this about a black guy in the office?
Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?
Kid doesn't have a romantic bone in his body.
Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates.
I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they���re the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You���re not alone sister. Let���s get a beer sometime.
