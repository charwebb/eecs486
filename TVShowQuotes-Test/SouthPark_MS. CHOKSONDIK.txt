You just put that thing together just now! I'm giving you a check minus.

Alright, children, as I'm sure you all remember, today we are going to continue our biology lesson... dissecting an organism.

Oh alright Butters. Take the bathroom pass and go.  Okay, so for instance, children-

Let's all say hello to Rancher Bob.

You can only use it in the non-literal sense. For instance,  "That's a shitty picture of me." is now fine. Hoever, the literal noun form of  "This is a picture of shit." is still naughty. 

Alright girls. Yesterday we went over the myriad of diseases you can get from boys, but today we're going to talk about the most horrible they can give you of all.  PREGNANCY!  That's right, since you girls have decided to be sexually active, teen pregnancy is at an all-time high! You seem to think it's gonna be fun and neat to have a baby-well, let's watch a little video, shall we?! 

Alright, class, I have your school photos to hand out-

Haawww. Haawww.

I'm sorry, Kyle. You'll just have to make do.  Now let's get back to the le-

Yes, unfortunately the school seems to be completely out of extra desks. So you'll just have to share with your cousin.

Well, I think people are just fed up with the crowded shopping and the credit-card bills, uh.  I, I think that the holiday just has become a joke.

Well we should make sure our students are good and scared of the consequences. We have to teach them that diseases are possible even with just oral sex.

No? Oh, oh well. Never mind. I've got a backup one in the desk.  Okay, today children, we're gonna learn about multiplying times five.

You know very well my name isn't Chokesonrocks, it's Choksondik! Say it right or you can go to the principal's with Butters!

Well, I'm quite happy without sex. I mean, with all the diseases and problems out there, who needs it, right?
