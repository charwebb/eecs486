Gabe...ugh... you got all close to these people. Got involved in their lives. Let's get you back to Florida. We'll figure out something for you.
Michael?
I've always been a fighter. And Fate has obliged me with plenty of battles, the first being a hard--
Mama Jo knew there was something up.
Luckily I have someone for you!
I hope your rough patch ends soon.
Well, buy property. That's my advice.
Question 1. Ever shot a gun in the office?
Enough!
Yeah, I want to hear more from you.
Hey!
How'd my girl Nellie do?
You'll probably feel better once you get some pants on. Come on.
Oh, God. How far has it gone?
Err, thank you very much. We, we don't get to see much coal in Tallahassee, I'm used to alligators, and some of the worst Chinese food you've ever tasted.
Michael?
And we didn't find anything on your computer.
Not long ago, we discovered a defect in one of our printers, so we got a software patch and fixed it right up, just like that. I don't know how it works. But just as we were about to send out a letter to our affected customers, giving 'em free toner, and we keep 'em, happy, but somebody here, they liked that first story better. The one where we lose half our clients for no damn good reason! Whoever it was who talked to the press, they should come forward, please.
Let me see what I can do.
