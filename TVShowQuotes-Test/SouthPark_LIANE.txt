And then I saw him. He was the most beautiful, charming piece of ass I'd ever seen in South Park. His name... was Chief Running Water.  I don't recall exactly how the rest of the night went, but the next morning I was pregnant with you, my little blueberry muffin.
Oh my God! Eric! Eric,  Mommy's here. Sweetie?  Oh, what's wrong with him?
Oh, that's so sweet. Oh, I love you too, poopiekins! 
Oh, why yes he did. I thought you were dead, Sharon.
Oh, what a party that was!  Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. 
Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again?
Eric, I got you a new history textbook. Why don't you come downstairs.
This says it does everything the iPad does, at half the price.
Eric, I want you to go upstairs and brush your teeth. Then I'll be up to read you a story before bed.  Oh my goodness. I can't believe it.
Oh, all right. I was just at the store buying some apples.
Oh, hello sweetie. What did you do today?
I love you very much, poopsiekins. You're Mommy's sunshine. 
Then why did you go outside to a police officer and say "Help! Help! My mommy is trying to fuck me!"?
Well, he's just... out of control. I mean, he never listens to me, and he pretty much runs my life.
Thank you so much for allowing Eric and I to stay here.
It's going to be okay, baby. We're going to get you more time.
Oh, that sounds fine. I'm going to a meteor shower party. The number where I'll be is on the refrigerator. Eric's nookie time is 9 o'clock sharp. If his little woogums get cold, you can turn up the heat over here. And if he gets cranky, just play tummy-rub-rubs with him, and make sure he wipes good after he makes bears.
Boopsie-kins, It's late. You need to be in bed.
Eric, I talked to you about beating up your friends, didn't I?
Here, I made you powdered donut pancake surprise.
No, sweetie, we have to tend to some of Grandma's business.
I mean, what right do I have bringing another child into this overpopulated world? Then again, I should've thought of that before having sex. then againuh-- Oh, I just don't know...
I think we need to get you a different brand, hon. They're a little cheaper.
I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town.
Eric, why would you do such a thing?
