But I just don't think I'm a fit mother.

Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous.

Your friends and I have all chipped in and we're going to send you up to a weight-management retreat.

Oh sure. 

Eh yes, sweetie.

Eric, sweetie, there's um, some people here to see you.

Oooooohh.

You'll get over it, honey.

She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it.

Oh my goodness, it's a fire. 

What is it, Eric?

How is your beefy roast, snookums?

That's okay, Eric, I think you need to go spend time with your little friends.

Would you boys like some Cheesy Poofs?

Ohhh, yes, indeedy. 

Sure hon.

I'm sorry, hon,

Whoa, Chef!  You're so strong!

Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps he should switch toothpaste?

Alright honey, let's take it easy.

Oh my.

Well, all right.  I guess I can get some groceries anyway. 

Eric, the day I met your father it was like - magic! It was a beautiful autumn night when the aspen trees were turning, at the Twelfth Annual Drunken Barn Dance. 

Oh, that's very interesting.

Well, I certainly won't buy him anymore, then... Bill. 

Oh, I've told him to respect people's property. What did he take?

Can't it wait till tomorrow, hon?

Tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night.

Eric, how would you like to go with me to see Madame Butterfly Friday night?

A million dollars?

Oh baby baby, you can't die.

What do you say, champ? Think you can tough it out?

Happy Halloween!

Yes. Every time somebody gets a birthday present Eric gets one too.  Otherwise, he gets a little upset.

Oh Cesar, I'm so happy to have you in my life. 

Mmmm. Beetles are good with ice cream.

Go ahead, snookums. It's probably one of your little friends.

What is it, sweetie?

Don't be nervous. I'm sure you'll win.

Eric Cartman...

You're very sweet. Thank you again. Come on, muffin. 

You too, Eric.

Eric, if you don't want to eat then, why don't you go brush your teeth and go to bed?!

What hon?

Yes?

No, Rumpertumskin, I didn't. I swear.

Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts.

Yes?  Oh hi.

Just a weensy geensy woo woo?

Ohh, it's a little late, sweetie. Why don't you boys just keep playing downstairs?

Coma... My God, fo- for how long?

Sure, hon.

Boopsie-kins, It's late. You need to be in bed.

You want some more Cheesy Poofs hon?

Oh. 

Yup, just like you said he would.

Oh dear. 

Are you sure, sweetie?
