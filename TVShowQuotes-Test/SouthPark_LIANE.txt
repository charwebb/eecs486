Go ahead, snookums. It's probably one of your little friends.
Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down.  Mommy has something to tell you. It's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric. I've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, I've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month.
Ooooh, he's just been feeling under the weather. Maybe you boys can cheer him up. He's in the backyard.
Oh well, no TV for him for a few days.
You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture.
Oooh, I'm gonna decorate the house for Halloween,
with scary ghosts and bats and creepy crawly things...
Hello there!
It's too far and your parents want you back home.
Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted to have a "talk" with you.
Sweetie, you really can just talk to me if you-
Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth.
Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?
It's the most wonderful time of the year
do do do do do do do do-
Eric? Sweetie, are you having nightmares about the Chinese again?
Well, why don't you get ready for snoogums' night-night, and I'll bring you some toasty chocolate nummers?
This year is gonna be different. Look!  I got you "Hooked On Monkey Fonics." 
Well, I don't know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare.
Right, because it will hybrid with all those other processors and generate a whole new era of technological darkness.
Eric, you're just going to have to be patient. 
Are you sure this is what you want, sweetie?
Oh, well, I'm not sure. Actually, Eric is still supposed to be grounded for trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks ago.
Wait. Wait.  Who is that?  Chief... could you excuse me for a minute?
Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're just fat. 
The KFC in Salida is a long way away, sweetie. Be patient.
You have to see the eye doctor, Eric.
Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous.
