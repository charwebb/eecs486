Well, all right.  I guess I can get some groceries anyway. 
Well, he's just... out of control. I mean, he never listens to me, and he pretty much runs my life.
I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town.
Hmmm. but you're not out of control, muffin. You're my perfect little gum drop.
You have been bad, so you're gonna have to drink from this glass. 
No, sweetie, we have to tend to some of Grandma's business.
Boopsie-kins, It's late. You need to be in bed.
Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?
Here, Kyle. Will you hold Great-Grandma's catheter bag during dinner? 
Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, his big-boned.
Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth.
I'm making you some lunch right now, Eric.
Oh, what a party that was!  Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. 
Hello. Um, I would like to... sign my son up, please.
Ah, no, these people claim that they are the "real" psychic detectives. 
Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're just fat. 
Oh, it's my pleasure. Eric loves his little friends.
Eric, Sister Anne has come to visit you.
How about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then?
Ohhh, oh. I'm not sure.  Sweetie, what is your condition?
Eric, what have we talked about with that language?! One more time and I'm not taking you anywhere!
Oh dear... I was checking out the Internet and ih, it almost seems like his symptoms are like those in something called "Tour, Tourette's Syndrome"?
Eric, you've done a lot of horrible things in your life, but smoking? You're grounded for three weeks!
Well, I don't know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare.
Oh... N- no, sweetie. I believe those Olympics are just for... "special" children.
