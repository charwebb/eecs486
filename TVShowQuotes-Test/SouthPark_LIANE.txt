Oh, Eric. I'm very proud of you.

Eric honey, time to get up for school. 

And then I saw him. He was the most beautiful, charming piece of ass I'd ever seen in South Park. His name... was Chief Running Water.  I don't recall exactly how the rest of the night went, but the next morning I was pregnant with you, my little blueberry muffin.

You're not fat, you're big boned.

I'm back, hon. I got some more calamine lotion. 

Oh, now why would he do that?

Orf course I do.

Oh, my poor little baby!

Well, go right ahead, Officer Barbrady.

Oh, all right.

You made me look like some sort of child molester in front of all those people!

Ohh, it's a little late, sweetie. Why don't you boys just keep playing downstairs?

Oh. Eh-hello, Dr. Roberts? It's Ms. Cartman.

Oh, I've told him to respect people's property. What did he take?

Cesar...

Well, what if I took you to Kentucky Fried Chicken afterward?  And then we'll go to Target and buy you a Mega Ranger.

Bad, Eric, bad! 

Yess, that's what I mean. Adoption.

Don't worry, sweetie, everything is fine.

If you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting anything!

Why hello there. I don't think I've seen you around before. 

I did it! 

Wheat. The building block of your favorite foods, and, Nebraska's principal source of economic productivity. You see, when Nebraska first became--

Oh well, no TV for him for a few days.

Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're just fat. 

What hon?

I... don't think it worked.

What's going on?

Oh, I just can't stand to see my baby suffer

Eric, if you don't want to eat then, why don't you go brush your teeth and go to bed?!

O-o-o-o-oh! 

Oh dear.

Mmmm.

I have to leave soon, Eric.

Okay, hon.

Sweetie, can't we go after school?

You'll get over it, honey.

Well, then. I know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with Mommy tonight.

Oh, oh, my baby has HIV!

Oh, thank you, thank you.

Oh my.

Oh dear.

There's just one problem: he still fights me every step of the way. I feel like he's doing what I tell him, but that inside he's still the same angry spoiled child.

Over the meadow and through the woods

Well, why don't you get ready for snoogums' night-night, and I'll bring you some toasty chocolate nummers?

What?

Oh ye-yes, of course,sweetie.

How is your beefy roast, snookums?

I just, I- I'm gonna go make you kids some lemonade. 

Oh Doctor, can you help him?

Uhoh, Thanksgiving's still a couple of weeks away, sweetie. I haven't gone shoppies yet.

Sure hon.

Come on, sweetie. Doctor says you need to get home and get lots of rest.

Eric, Sister Anne has come to visit you.

Oh, my little poopsie-kins gets into no-nos once in a while, but he's still my perfect little plumsy-kiddle

Oh no uh- I didn't mean that. I meant the other thing you can do-what's that other A word?

Alright honey, let's take it easy.

Eric, stop acting like a spoiled brat! You can either have the Toshiba Handibook or you can have nothing at all!
