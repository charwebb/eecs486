Now, Eric, let's try to get out of that grumpy mood before we get to Grandma's.
Over the meadow and through the woods

Eric, we're almost to Frisco. Why don't we go to the Church's Fried Chicken there?

That's okay, Eric, I think you need to go spend time with your little friends.

Well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest.

What do you say, champ? Think you can tough it out?

Eric, snookums! it's time for Mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night.  Eric, are you out there in your clubhouse?

Hehh, it doesn't look like our protest is working.

Well, I certainly won't buy him anymore, then... Bill. 

Well, he's just... out of control. I mean, he never listens to me, and he pretty much runs my life.

I know. I know he's out of control. But... you don't know what it's like.  I'm sorry. It's just that... he seems to get worse every day.  He just never listens.

Do you see that, Sheila? The Williamses are shopping here.

Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days.

Sweetie, let the nice firemen do their job.

Come on, sweetie. Doctor says you need to get home and get lots of rest.

It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother.

There's just one problem: he still fights me every step of the way. I feel like he's doing what I tell him, but that inside he's still the same angry spoiled child.

It's not him, it's you, Eric.  I don't know what to do with you.

And don't get too close to Kyle. He looks like he might have the AIDS. 

Wait. Wait.  Who is that?  Chief... could you excuse me for a minute?

Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chickenpox, just so I would get it.

Stanley told me you had passed on. I'm glad to see that you're better.

Oh, all right. I was just at the store buying some apples.

Oh I never saw him after that. Ah-I wasn't really that interested in him.

My little Eric can sometimes be a bit... dramatic. 

Eric?  It must be his time. I think it's running out!
