What is your name?
We have some *delicious* Chateau Briande, my personal favourite. Or, if you prefer something lighter, a poached Dover sole in a delicate white wine sauce with just a *hint* of saffron.
Look. This plane is *full*. I got a lot of people to serve. Now please... You're just gonna have to wait.
Aaye Mr Kramer....You like Cadillacs?
