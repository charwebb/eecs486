Oh yes, uh, Mr. Garrison, have a seat
Erica, I believe we have a solution to this little problem.
It was an error of judgment, Mr. Mackey, but I'm afraid I have to let you go for it. We searched each one of those kids, but came up empty.
You demonstrate a lack of tolerance for Mr. Garrison's behavior. In fact, I believe you used the words "sick queer" to describe his conduct in class?
He finally snapped and had a nervous breakdown and... went up into the mountains to live in solitude.
Yes, but you don't actually get involved with the child's life. You're supposed to just send money, and once in a while they write you a letter. You see, Marvin didn't grow up in a normal place like South Park.
We... found all the gay porn on your iPhone, Mr. Connors.
We've simply had it with your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Voting just doesn't appear to be important to him.
Eric, I've had enough! You cannot and you will not sell your books on school grounds! Do I make myself clear?!
Mr. Garrison, Chef has brought it to my attention that some uh students are a bit... uuuncomfortable about certain aspects of your teaching methods.
All right, boys, now what is this fighting all about?
This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about, Eric. You get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen. This time you've done it to yourself!
Sshh! Oh, God bless America.  You get into my office before anyone else sees you. I have to show you an educational video.
Sooo Eric Cartman just has us in some kind of bathroom checkmate?
Eric, we've been informed by a concerned student that you are writing naughty books about one of the girls here at the school.
When you have cancer you fight, because it doesn't matter if you beat it or not. You refuse to let that fat little lump make you feel powerless!
Where did you get that costume, young man?!
Ooookay, thank you, cheerleaders. That was very nice. Ahhh, next we have a student who would like to perform an original rap song,  based on his award-winning poem, "I Was Not The Bullet," with backup music by Butters Stotch.
