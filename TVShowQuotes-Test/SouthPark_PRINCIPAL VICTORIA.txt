All right, all right, I killed him. I hit him over the head and I cut up the body. I tried to burn him, but it wouldn't burn! Oh, the smell of it! I put the legs in garbage bags and hid the torso under a bridge. I HAD TO DO IT!!  OH GOD!!!
All we ask is you keep it shorter.
It was an error of judgment, Mr. Mackey, but I'm afraid I have to let you go for it. We searched each one of those kids, but came up empty.

I'm sorry Mr. Garrison, but it's obvious you aren't tolerant of your own behavior.

This story hasn't gone up on Eavesdropper yet. Maybe it won't!
Mrs. Garrison, I am pulling you out of the classroom.
I'm sorry, the board has made up their minds.
Yes, Mr. Garrison. Have a seat.  Mr. Garrison, sometime ago you asked to be promoted from teaching kindergarten back to the third grade.
Alright Eric, here's the deal: This school cannot have another suicide on its hands. We want you to see Pete Melman through this, and turn public opinion around.
Well, I was just saying that the policies have really changed. You know, we fire you for acting gay next time, you'd be able to sue the school district for ...lots of money.
You'd better brace yourself, parents. The boys were caught... smoking!
