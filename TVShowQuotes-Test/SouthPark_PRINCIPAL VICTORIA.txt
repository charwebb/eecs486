You'd better brace yourself, parents. The boys were caught... smoking!

Oh yes, uh, Mr. Garrison, have a seat

Miss Stevenson, I will need to inform the police.

We had to let them go home, and one of them now has half a lid of Jamaican grass because of you!

Well, you have to admit he does look a little better.

It has become obvious to me that you don't know enough about evolution to teach it! I'm having you replaced! Mr. Dawkins! 

You sure this will work, Eric? What if some of the students don't eat the pizza?

You demonstrate a lack of tolerance for Mr. Garrison's behavior. In fact, I believe you used the words "sick queer" to describe his conduct in class?

I want to know just what makes you think it's okay to go inside the girls bathroom!

Yes, will there be gluten-free options for people at this party?

Mrs. Garrison, I am pulling you out of the classroom.

Mr. Gar- Mr. Garrison!  Could we speak with you please?

I'm sorry Erica, but I spoke with Wendyl this morning and she's not comfortable-

Students and faculty, please put your hands together and help me in welcoming back, Mister Garrison. 

Well, that does it! I'm suspending you, Timmy, until you can learn to respect your elders! 

School policy has been to teach sexual education later. In the fifth grade.

I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid we have to terminate your employment here at South Park Elementary.

I told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.
