Listen Eric! You must know why we can't have you in the girls bathroom!

You must remove that costume, immediately!

You can appeal to the city council, but I don't think it'll do any good. Your son must leave South Park, never to return.

Oh, man, this is boring!

We-hell, "sorry" isn't going to cut the cheese this time, mister! I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you from school.

Eh-excuse me?

Well, Ms. Makaraqesh, you certainly tried to put one over on us, boy howdy. Take her away!

You're sorry for what, Eric?

Yes, we need to go over it again in the classroom so they understand what really happened.

Congratulations. How do you feel?

Oh. Oh, wow! WOWuh! 

Oookay, but you probably understand that for Pete, it isn't that funny. For him it's embarrassing and terrifying.

No, it's just that the announcements need to be quick so the students can get on with their work.

All students are to evacuate the school immediately! 

Then it's decided: no more condom classes in grade school.

Okay. 

I think tonight the planetarium is doing Laser Loggins. I might have to check it out.

Sooo Eric Cartman just has us in some kind of bathroom checkmate?

Well, congratulations!

Don't listen to them, kids. You have to go to school.

Well, that certainly would explain it.

Well, why the hell would you dress up like Evel Knievel?  Anyway, I hope that you kids are-Daagh!  Eric, God bless it, what do you think you're doing?!

What's a bigger story than all the students being made sick?

Come on in. 

Please just let it go.

Why would we publish the lengths of our students' private parts?

Oh, Jesus Christ.

I wanna come clean with you and tell you that back then some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences. It was wrong of us, and I want to make it up to you.
