Just hang with us for a bit. We'll fill you in on everything you haven't been told. 

Ow! Oo-uhow! Ow! Hey, man, what are you doing?! Ow, stop it!

Would you like a ride into town? I'm on my way to Master Thomas Jefferson's hosue to get a very important document, I am.

Awhuh! What?!

An airport?! But...?

You'd better watch yourself next time, abandoner!
