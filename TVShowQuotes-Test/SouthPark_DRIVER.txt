No, the plane crashed. We're in the Colorado mountains somewhere.  Matt? Matt?!  My husband. He said the outbreak was all over the news, but everything was totally fine where he was.

What?! What is it, please?! Hurry, my husband might still be alive!

It's on the impound list. You owe the county for tickets. 

'Kay. What's stuck to the bottom of the bus?
