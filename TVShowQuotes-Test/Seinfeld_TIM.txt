Listen, Elaine, I've been wanting to ask you...would you like to go out with me New Years Eve? (Elaine thinks Tim is offering her a nut, and shakes her head no. Tim, rejected, walks away.) Thanks.
And you really don't look like a Murphy.
What the *Hell* is going on here? How do you *lose* a human being?!
