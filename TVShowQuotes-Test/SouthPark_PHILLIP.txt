Ugly Bob, your face looks like somebody tried to put out a forest fire with a screwdriver.
Dammit man!  Danger or no, I'm going to help my friend find his daughter!! 
Say Terrance, what should we do aboot this strange planet we've crashed on?
Terrance, if I die whilst in Iran, please bring my body back to Canada, and bury me in a box with a side of Kraft Dinner.
Why the heck didn't you tell me you were the mechanic?
But it's not free! If you charge 40 cents here and 50 cents there, then it's not free!
But there's something very wrong with knowingly making it appeal to human weaknesses!
Terrance, what brand of pants am I wearing?
That smelly Saddam Hussein. He uses germ and chemical warfare, does he not?
Oh dear! I knew we should have gone to Geico!  Come on, darling, let's get out of here and go there.
