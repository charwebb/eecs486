You censored out the image of Mohammad in our television special!!
Why the heck didn't you tell me you were the mechanic?
We understand micropaying, but can't the game hidden inside the charade it- just at least be fun?
No no no! I mean, could you tell me the directions again without you farting?
Then I'm going to go with you, Terrance. 
Really? Well that sounds interesting. How much does it pay?
Ah, I'm sick of him taking credit for all the work and not letting me change the act. It's old and stale! I mean, do you really think that fart jokes are funny for that long? 
But it's not free! If you charge 40 cents here and 50 cents there, then it's not free!
Well, what the hell? I already flew all the way out here. But I want my check made out to me, not both of us!
Me too, Katherine. I don't love your queefs, but dammit, I love you.
