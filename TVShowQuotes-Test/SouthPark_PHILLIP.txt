Hey, Terrance, I think I have to fart. 
Yes. This bomb will blow us both to smithereens. But we really have no choice. Only our deaths can bring Canada life. 
We understand micropaying, but can't the game hidden inside the charade it- just at least be fun?
Dammit I'm trying to enjoy my wine, Katie!
Say, she looks a lot more like Celine Dion than you, Terrance.  Oooh, now I see the resemblance!
Terrance, if I die whilst in Iran, please bring my body back to Canada, and bury me in a box with a side of Kraft Dinner.
But there's something very wrong with knowingly making it appeal to human weaknesses!
What gives you the right to make a stupid Terrance & Phillip mobile game?! Who do you think you are?!
Did you hear that, Terrance? You're not guilty!
Hey! Wait a minute. That fart gives me pause.
