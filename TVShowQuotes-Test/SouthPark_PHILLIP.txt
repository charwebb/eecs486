Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart.

That fart sounded like a ringing phone, Terrance.

That's what I was gonna say: You were an asshole, and this is mostly your fault.  But, you were always the more artistically driven of us; I ssshould've put more into it than I did. 

Oh dear! I knew we should have gone to Geico!  Come on, darling, let's get out of here and go there.

Terrance, what brand of pants am I wearing?

Ugly Bob, your face looks like somebody tried to put out a forest fire with a screwdriver.

Oh my God!  What is this?!  Is this Canada?

Hey! Wait a minute. That fart gives me pause.

Say Terrance, what should we do aboot this strange planet we've crashed on?

Yes it is, Terrance. According to that newsie, he's some kind of Turkish dictator.
