Ryan.
Keep me out of it.
Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done. [laughs]
Split the commission?
Is she Asian?
...and a big walk-in closet.
Oh, I like Olive Garden.
I don't get it.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I gave you a penguin.
Thanks guys.
Oh, some fudge?
Your show was really great, Andy.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. [laughs]
Oh dear.
Yes, it's marijuana.
Yes.
We think you made a big, big mistake.
Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!
[as everyone returns to the office] Ah, geez. My nails aren't dry yet. I don't think I can work for at least a couple hours.
Michael!
Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He���s not terrible.
Order carrot cake. [laughter]
It's the lining of the stomach of--
Yeah, I���m not ready for this.
[hands Jim folder] Ask for Donald, Karen���s bananas.
Come on, Dwight, I think it's actually healthy to get it off your chest.
I thought you said green was whorish.
It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good!
I'll start with a side salad, then a chicken piccata.
Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering.
When I say it out loud it's so silly. [they both laugh]
What are you? A monk?
Oh, I know I'd be more productive.
Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw.  So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this. [whispering] So we're gonna try out some new things today.
Oh, it can be fun.
Yeah, that sounds right.
Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat.
What?
Open the door, Jim.
She's real good.
We bury him?
I can't see half of the things. [adjusts glasses]
When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.
It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.
[in the conference room with Pam, Angela, and Meredith] How about cupcakes?
Look, I don���t feel safe. I think we should call the police.
Oh, yeah. You'll have to put out.
Well, Andy���s cute, but he���s too vanilla, whereas Pete - he���s just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird.
Oh, boy... You...
We know the branch is closing; Michael told us.
Michael.
Magical...
I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it?
Her nephew's in Iraq.
Hey!
Angela, you'll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it's the generic one. It's Stanley's favorite.
Michael?
Really? I thought they were pretty...
I'll talk to her, Michael.
Lots of things are cozy in the rain.
Michael, we have a lot of work to do.
Andy.
What's the least we can do to make this okay?
Thank you.
I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.
I, uh, I met a man and I'm totally in love, and that's a chapter of my life that I thought had closed. Uh, I was terribly depressed for the longest time and I have to admit I had some very dark thoughts...
What--
What? [everyone is confused]
Is that ladle stainless or...
And if the food stations are here and here... no!  Here and here.  Drinks here, then people can mingle.  But then where would the band go?
Michael... No.
Ms. Thomas, so good to see you.
20 cartons of it's coming, on it's way.
Wait. This says ���Dunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledge���?
Well?
Dwight?
Yeah you have this sexy glow.
Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can���t just press a magic button.
What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.
I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.
[on the phone] You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?
You shot Dwight?
Maybe that's not the best one. Keep reading.
I'd rather have the bowl.
Are you gonna give me the leads or not?
Yeah, who wrote it?
That's the character's name?
Thanks.
He does have a moustache.
Live and learn.
Here's her carrier, but no Cece.
[Takes here gift out of her bowl] Oh. What are these?
Let's do it!
Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them.
That's still a lot of money!
I know
What does that mean?
Mmm, this won't help him, it's a muffin, not cake.
Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't...
What are you wearing?
Who was Pam's first celebrity crush?
So is it an open relationship?
I do.
I don't care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise.
Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.
Then how is this 'Amazing Race'?
Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?
