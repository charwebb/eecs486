Alright. Sounds like somebody wants to walk away with this. [holds up large check for $2,000]
��� is communicating a message to the other. Nothing is mutua-- this isn't very helpful. You're gonna want to hear the sexual metaphor.
Andy, we're going to go with Nellie as manager and put you back on the sales team. I promise you, in time, we'll all laugh about this incident. I already think it's kind of funny. [chuckles]
[on the phone] Andrew, I've picked up two possible gifts to bring this afternoon. One, a pot of marmalade.
Well, it's mine. You took it out of my bag.
And of course, the pool. The ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. It was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness.
Are you telling me that there���s no one in this entire office that could use an extra pair of hands?
Forget the beets. Concentrate on the hosting. I could spend a considerable amount of money having my birthday party here.
[loudly knocking on the window] In four seconds my wife is going to be coming through that door. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen. [to Mrs. California] There you are! Honey how on earth could you miss the elevator?
It's the standard one. The one everyone has.
You know I suppose someone should enjoy the place before I hand it over to the staging experts at Remax tomorrow.  Let's try this: everyone, tonight, my house, wear a swimsuit. Let's just call it a get-together. And let's say no food.
Excellent. Excellent. Though troubling that your first instinct is thievery.
[laughs] I've never believed willpower was very important in a woman.
Andrew, not everyone here is important. And the word is 'impotence.'
Probably shouldn���t have said that. [Jim���s jaw drops]
Not destroyed. No..... Not destructive. Quite...off-kilter, sure. But... that's too vague. [long pause] Erratic. Darkly erratic. [laughs awkwardly] That's my mood.
You want a three and half day weekend for Columbus Day?
Where���s the Advil, Jim? I think I���ve hit my limit on the Tylenol ��� Oh.
We live in this world of routines and rhythms. Kevin ate someone's lunch. Phyllis has a new necklace. Who is this woman?
Yes, Andrew. And you, on this day of fantasy, are a laborer.
This humble but sincere effort is all for our valued new colleague. Excellent.
I also mentioned the marmalade to my sister and she's very interested.
Some people doodle at work when they let their mind run. They draw houses, penises. Funny how the houses are always colonials and the penises are always circumcised. Don���t you think? Well, I doodle too, but I���m not an artist. So I draw words and lists.
Hold one finger up to Susan. You���ll just be a second. You numbskull. You were given a very simple task. I could not have been more clear with you. Now say, ���are you taking your medicine?���
