Well, it's mine. You took it out of my bag.
Andy! Andy, could you step in here, please? We'll fix this.
Yes, Andrew. And you, on this day of fantasy, are a laborer.
Well Nellie, I'm sorry. If I'd known Jim and Pam would use this party as an excuse to abuse a magician-
Everyone, conference room, now. [Dwight and Gabe stand up, falling over]
When two animals are having sex, one of them...
I���m not gonna change my list, Andy, and I don���t use ballpoint pens.
There���s someone else I need to thank. His name is Oscar Martinez.
The situation you described, returning home to a wife complaining about her paper being too masculine, is not one I'm familiar with.
Jim, your daughter, Cecilia. What does she think of the street?
The state senator, Robert Lipton, loves dogs. he asked me if I loved dogs. you know what I said? Yes! [laughter.]
Ugh, I hate ties! I feel like I'm being strangled like I'm at some erotic asphyxiation sex club over on I-84. The red room say? Or Dominick's?
So I think you know what we want to know.
Let's you and I take a walk. Oscar, you're in charge of the bar.
Gentlemen, bear witness. While I've been mourning the nights that never were, one of them has been unfolding here before me. This is no get-together. This is a party. [Robert strips, jumps in pool, Gabe and Ryan join him]
Ah, well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penised debutante. You wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on. You���re gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets. You don���t even know my real name. I���m the *bleep* lizard king. [disconnects]
You were dining alone? All those people are you?
I don't think you would have shown up to work nearly an hour late for no reason.
I play harmonica. I think I have one in the car.
Just taking a stroll. What exactly have I stumbled upon here?
Have you considered the possibility that you slept with a drifter?
I am so eager to hear your game-changers. Let's dig in, shall we?
And of course, the pool. The ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. It was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness.
Andy, do you know why I chose you?
