Right.  I mean you���re an accountant.  Those bogus prospectuses must drive you insane.
Jim, I told Andy to come in, and yet he is still not in. By contrast, Nellie Bertram saw a vacuum and filled it. To make no mention of her business experience or her relationship with Jo Bennett, my boss.
No, no, no, no. There's something going on. Some stress in your life.
All life is sex. And all sex is competition.
There���s someone else I need to thank. His name is Oscar Martinez.
I'll say a few words if that's alright with you, Andy.
Everyone, conference room, now. [Dwight and Gabe stand up, falling over]
And of course, the pool. The ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. It was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness.
It depends Jim. Do you find one-day only Jet Blue sales to Buffalo interesting?
My body has somehow become acclimated to southern Italy. Isn't that strange? I've never been there! Oh, ah, yes, that's nice. Thank you.
Hold one finger up to Susan. You���ll just be a second. You numbskull. You were given a very simple task. I could not have been more clear with you. Now say, ���are you taking your medicine?���
[telling story to Nellie.] I stepped in right away and start--
I have decided. Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up. As Solomon once said��� [Andy walks out]
I'm not accustomed to people saying no to me. [laughs]
It's mid-recession in a depressed area of a faltering state and I've got the most expensive house on the market. The one percent are suffering too, people. I wanted it to be my Playboy mansion. A temple to wine, revelry, sex, intrigue... this was hot on the heels of Eyes Wide Shut, mind you. Then I met my wife, she moved in, made it her own. Now she's left me and forced me to sell the place. The ultimate insult? They're calling my speakeasy lounge a rumpus room. [Jim laughs] Does my turmoil amuse you, Jim?
And there are no rules to that game. That wasn't so perverted, now was it?
Some people doodle at work when they let their mind run. They draw houses, penises. Funny how the houses are always colonials and the penises are always circumcised. Don���t you think? Well, I doodle too, but I���m not an artist. So I draw words and lists.
Andrew, if you say no one more time, you're fired. So... is there anything else you wanna say?
Andy, where shall I put your basil plant?
[to Kevin] You seem unimpressed.  Ghosts don���t scare you?
I had two bears sewn together to make this king-size. Total waste of two bears.
Can you call security, tell 'em to keep an eye out for him? Time to settle this.
Pam, we need to get to the bottom of this.
Why can you not say exactly what I tell you? Undo this. Undo it. [Robert and Andy hang up phones]
