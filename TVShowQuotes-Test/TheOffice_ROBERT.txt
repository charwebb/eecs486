Well, perhaps this party will awaken the baby in all of us.
All life is sex. And all sex is competition.
Andrew sometimes I feel like you don't know me at all.
When I was a boy, there was an empty house just up the hill from my family's. It was rumored a man committed suicide there after being possessed by the devil. One day, a young woman, Lydia, moved into the house with her infant child. That very night, Lydia was awakened by a loud, heinous hissing sound. [hisses] She walked to the nursery, and there, in baby's crib, was a snake wrapped around baby's neck, squeezing tighter and tighter.
That's the oatmeal cookie. Fantastic, Kevin. Fantastic. [laughs]
This idea hasn't gripped me. What else did you come up with?
You were dining alone? All those people are you?
Why? Not only are you terrible at squash, but you don't even seem to enjoy it. Jim, this is not enough of a challenge for me.
I hope so. The corporate party was wretched. I am so tired of the Black Eyed Peas. It's rock-n-roll for people who don't like rock-n-roll. It's rap for people who don't like rap. It's pop for people who don't like pop.....ah, heartbreaking. [gestures to Andy in Santa costume]
Good morning, Robert,' says no one because our receptionist is in Florida. [no one responds] Pam!
You're clearly under a lot of... stress with the moving and the work situation you've found yourself in.
My body has somehow become acclimated to southern Italy. Isn't that strange? I've never been there! Oh, ah, yes, that's nice. Thank you.
My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin. In the end, doesn't he decide who the manager is?
No, no. I'm very comfortable with all things sexual. Continue.
Interesting. Yes. No, yes, I see that. Great work, team. Great party.
I did not know about the sales figures.
It's mid-recession in a depressed area of a faltering state and I've got the most expensive house on the market. The one percent are suffering too, people. I wanted it to be my Playboy mansion. A temple to wine, revelry, sex, intrigue... this was hot on the heels of Eyes Wide Shut, mind you. Then I met my wife, she moved in, made it her own. Now she's left me and forced me to sell the place. The ultimate insult? They're calling my speakeasy lounge a rumpus room. [Jim laughs] Does my turmoil amuse you, Jim?
Right.  I mean you���re an accountant.  Those bogus prospectuses must drive you insane.
So I think you know what we want to know.
I���m not gonna change my list, Andy, and I don���t use ballpoint pens.
David has generously offered to donate one million dollars in matching funds to a cause that's very dear to me. So, for the next three years, I'll be travelling overseas, concentrating all of my efforts on educating- mentoring, some African, some Asian, but mainly Eastern European women.
The fifth one is for you, Erin. You could take it or leave it. To take it would be to accept that you're at a party and you're an adult woman, with an adventurous spirit. To leave it would be fine too.
I just think you guys are winners and I wanted to have lunch with you.
There���s something about an underdog that really inspires���the unexceptional.
