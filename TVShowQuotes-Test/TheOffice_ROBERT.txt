Andy, it's Robert. Why aren't you at work?
Vanilla? No no no no.  You���ll never guess in a million billion years you���ll never guess.
Now why would you come to a bar and ask for a cola when you can get some from the kitchen? Did some small part of you want something a little stronger? Ryan, Kevin, Phyllis, Oscar, come and take these shots!
Is this a video conference you're having with 'Drake, featuring Swizz Beatz'?
Andrew, if you say no one more time, you're fired. So... is there anything else you wanna say?
Andy, can you inspire? Do you have that skill set?
What could you possibly have found funny in what I said? What was the joke you thought you heard?
There���s something about an underdog that really inspires���the unexceptional.
Probably shouldn���t have said that. [Jim���s jaw drops]
Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There���s no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems��� so poorly timed.

Can you call security, tell 'em to keep an eye out for him? Time to settle this.
You want a three and half day weekend for Columbus Day?
I would be eternally grateful. It���s not a bad thing to have the CEO owe you one.
Dwight. Today is not my day at all, I'm afraid. I'm not going to be able to meet with you, but I'm leaving you in the very capable hands of our COO.
I am the CEO and I am telling an employee of mine what to do.
No, no, no, no. There's something going on. Some stress in your life.
Oprah Winfrey's leadership academy and other schools like it, while wonderful, end with high school. I want to see these girls right through college, especially the gymnasts. They've lost so many years of crucial education to perfecting their bodies. Muscle groups the rest of us can't even fathom.
Kevin, you've been quiet. I'm curious to know what your game-changer is.
