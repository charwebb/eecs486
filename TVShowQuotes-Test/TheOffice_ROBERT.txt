Ah.
This idea hasn't gripped me. What else did you come up with?
Pam, we need to get to the bottom of this.
David has generously offered to donate one million dollars in matching funds to a cause that's very dear to me. So, for the next three years, I'll be travelling overseas, concentrating all of my efforts on educating- mentoring, some African, some Asian, but mainly Eastern European women.
The rest of you, let's throw a party at the end of the day to welcome the newest member of our little community.
This whole accusation is insulting. Come on.
I���m not kidding.
No, I'm sorry, I just can't sit idly by and have the gay youth of America misled by some reductionist-
[laughs] I've never believed willpower was very important in a woman.
And of course, the pool. The ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. It was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness.
Yeah.
The situation you described, returning home to a wife complaining about her paper being too masculine, is not one I'm familiar with.
[to dwight] Did you need something from us?
Hello, Andy.  Excellent tie.
You're a band.
Well, perhaps this party will awaken the baby in all of us.
Jim what are you���What a surprise.
I play harmonica. I think I have one in the car.
What could you possibly have found funny in what I said? What was the joke you thought you heard?
[to camera] What am I up to?
Fear plays an interesting role in our lives. How dare we let it motivate us. How dare we let it into our decision making, into our livelihoods, into our relationships. It's funny, isn't it, we take a day a year to dress up in costume and celebrate fear.
You made it.
How are you adjusting to life in Scranton so far?
My serve!
and the hero, who's that based on?
Last night at dinner Susan and I were talking about her returning to work. So she���s here today to see if there���s a good fit. Something tells me it just might work out. This is Andy Bernard the regional manager.
Eleven love. I win again.
Sesame street.
That is very cold.
What are we talking about?
Have you seen a ghost?
Good.
Yep.
[laughing] Hello, ah. Merry Christmas, Erin. Kelly, Happy Pancha Ganapati.
Skinned knee.
[holds a medal to the light] This medal was my grandfather's. He received it for acts of courage. For excellence. It's a tribute one man gives another. I could give you a job, Dwight. Why not let me give you something even better? [holds out medal]
You should see the whole thing.
That's the oatmeal cookie. Fantastic, Kevin. Fantastic. [laughs]
Your heart is broken. So is mine.
Andy, that's very kind--
Well what is the idea?
Andy, do you know why I chose you?
