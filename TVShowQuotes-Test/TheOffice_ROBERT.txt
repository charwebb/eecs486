It���s a wrong answer.
Hold one finger up to Susan. You���ll just be a second. You numbskull. You were given a very simple task. I could not have been more clear with you. Now say, ���are you taking your medicine?���
Yeah.
Take a look at where you are, where you once worked in a dying industry, you now work at it���s birth.  Those superstores are terrified of us.  Anybody know why?
[on the computer screen] I���ll say it again for mis amigos latinos. Yo soy homosexual.
Andy, do you know why I chose you?
Okay, enough of this. I mean, really, enough. It's gotten way out of hand. Andrew, this is my wife. Whatever privacy you were trying to protect between us, I thank you for. But it is not welcome right now. Just be honest.
If the office superstore was supposed to put us little suppliers out of business, why are we still here?
What are your thoughts.
Well...
Might as well have been sketching a cube.
Ow! Damn it, Kevin! God!
To the kitchen. Onward!
Jiminey Christmas indeed.
Ah.
Yeah.
Let's wait, until we have something to smoke about.
Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me.
They haven't really improved on the Oreo, have they?
Jim, would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor?
Yeah, so I'm hoping to identify some truly exceptional women who show great promise. Well, Andy, it's been fun.
I just did.
Why did I choose Andy to run the office? Because he���s all surface, uncomplicated. What you see is what you get. Could be a recipe for mediocrity, yes, but then again, it might just be why people fight for him.
Andy. Let���s see if there���s a good fit first. Then we���ll talk.
Lovely. Wait, where is this taking place?
Yes, that's it. Push yourselves, boys. It's not a party if you don't do something that scares you. I need a breather. Oh. Oh. You two keep going.
Skinned knee.
Nellie! You've been terrific in your interim capacity. But, Andrew is the rightful manager so if you would just give him his office-
[laughing] Hello, ah. Merry Christmas, Erin. Kelly, Happy Pancha Ganapati.
I'd love to give you a little rundown on what I've learned about this place.
And of course, the pool. The ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. It was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness.
I once believed that a gay person could be somewhat straight. It wasn���t until my marriage to Angela that I realized how���charmless I find the female body.
Hmm.
Everyone's better than this, because this is the worst thing I have ever seen. [drinks coconut penis energy drink] Why'd they add coconut? I miss original.
[to Kevin] You seem unimpressed.  Ghosts don���t scare you?
So I think you know what we want to know.
Excuse me?
Oscar. A pleasure.
What are we talking about?
Probably shouldn���t have said that. [Jim���s jaw drops]
Ugh, I hate ties! I feel like I'm being strangled like I'm at some erotic asphyxiation sex club over on I-84. The red room say? Or Dominick's?
I pictured myself here every night eating a leg of mutton, the juices dripping down my bare chest, wiping my fingers on the walls. Then I met the vegan.
