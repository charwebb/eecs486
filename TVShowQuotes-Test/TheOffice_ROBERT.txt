That's the oatmeal cookie. Fantastic, Kevin. Fantastic. [laughs]
Yeah.
[sees Jim's abandoned car] That's weird. Well, he's gotta be around here somewhere.
I���m never uncomfortable.
I'll say a few words if that's alright with you, Andy.
[telling story to Nellie.] I stepped in right away and start--
Andrew, I think this may have been a bad idea. Why don't you let me pay for you and Erin to go out to a great romantic dinner tonight?
It's been ten days since I had sexual intercourse.
The rest of you, let's throw a party at the end of the day to welcome the newest member of our little community.
I've been married thrice and each has ended in an acrimonious divorce, I'm not sure I'm the best person to give love advice....I was hoping you were gonna make me feel better.
[to dwight] Did you need something from us?
You should see the whole thing.
Thank you.
Andy, that's very kind--
Oo!
Last week an accounting mistake resulted in a client getting their order for free.
[on the computer screen] I would just to start by saying that there have been some rumors about my personal life that I would like to settle once and for all. As my long-suffering wife can attest��� I am gay.
So, here what we can do. Game changers- changes to the game such that the game can never be played the same way again. Everyone, brainstorm some innovations. Don't be afraid to get weird with it. Meredith! [wakes her up] Excited!
Pam, when���s the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldn���t hold the memories in?
Yeah.
That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object... whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction we've had already, you won't be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim?
I should go.
Have you seen a ghost?
You alright?
Dwight. Today is not my day at all, I'm afraid. I'm not going to be able to meet with you, but I'm leaving you in the very capable hands of our COO.
Can you call security, tell 'em to keep an eye out for him? Time to settle this.
I���m not kidding.
Shopaholic.
Andrew. [Robert extends his hand.]
Hello.
Cookies. Cookie placement.
I have decided. Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up. As Solomon once said��� [Andy walks out]
Guys, please help yourself to some drinks from the fridge.
Andy. Let���s see if there���s a good fit first. Then we���ll talk.
You���re blackmailing me.
Have you considered the possibility that you slept with a drifter?
Nellie?
What, as some sort of last hoorah?
Looks terribly real, doesn't it, Creed?
Andy! Andy, could you step in here, please? We'll fix this.
Oh, for god ���
What could you possibly have found funny in what I said? What was the joke you thought you heard?
