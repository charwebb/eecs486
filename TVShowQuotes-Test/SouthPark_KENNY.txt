(You guys! You guys, oh shit, come check this out!)Â 

(You guys, come get this fucking magnet noooowwww!)  (Argh--!)

(Perhaps, he's just too big to get out of bed) 

(You guys! You guys, I did it! I got my very own period!)

(Dude, shut the fuck up about my house!)

(Oh, there, there now. There's nothing to be afraid of, dear.) 

(No, swear to God it's true! Cartman's got a million dollars!)

(Yeah.)  (It isn't fair I was so close to getting a blow job and I'll never get one now - this is fucking bullshit...) 

(I'm not ruining my life, okay, you God damned fucking psychos.)

(All right. How am I supposed to do that?)

(Well, I think you guys should name it Steve)

My dearest friends.
I am living amongst the natives in the remote and tiny island of Kava'i. What can I tell you of this mysterious island and its people? It is a place of wonder, and yet to the outsider like me, a place of odd tradition. The people here are peaceful and joyous, and seem to care little for the rush and worry of the outside world. Their diet is mostly an odd mixture of coconut milk, pineapple juice, and vodka, which they call the chi-chi. As for Butters, he is quickly learning the ways of his ancestors, and seems to be feeling better with every passing day. He still seems quite angry at times, but luckily his ceremony will finally take place on the morrow.

(Yeah, it's like killing a dead pig and a turkey.) 

(Yeah, that's because you vomit on her all the time.) 

(Are you fuckin' telling me that I could've fuckin' gone that way?!)

(Yes! Woohoo! I did it! I reached level s-!)
