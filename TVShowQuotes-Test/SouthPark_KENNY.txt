(I said, Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)
(You can change your mind instead of fighting with us, Eric.)
(This is not herpes, it's a cold sore!)
(All right! Come on, let's get to the parking lot. Woo-hoo!) 
(Yeah! Take this, Professor Chaos!)  (Feel my wrath!) 
My dear friends of the mainland,
What adventures I have found on the tiny island of Kava'i. I have truly become one with the natives, who found new courage to fight their oppressors.
(I did! I was really excited to get a B.J. but now I have to wear this motherfucking purity ring!)
(Hey dude, I like to shave my balls.)
(I think if we run, try to get Eric to drop his tea)
(Dude, maybe he's like mentally ill or something)
(You never seem to care when I die!)
(It means I'm gonna be pure and not have sex until I get married.)
(And then we gotta go down and get a piece of paper and write down each one of the words we sang on the tape deck. And then, sing it back again!)
(I just LOVE this jacket 'cause it's SOOO beautiful!)
(Well, why do I have to be the one to go and find chicks?)
(All I know is that it was a loong time ago, and Death was chasing us on a bicycle down the street.)
