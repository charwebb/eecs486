Which ones?
I'm feeling eighty-two, eighty-two and a half.
Hey, guys.
So these are your cheeses, your ham, your sausages, your herbs, and your vegetables. Here's what's been done, so start creating. Some times it helps to think of a part of the world, and...
We just want to say how grateful we are.
Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? I���m pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines.
I could quit. Problem solved.
The alternative is termination. [Michael stares off, considering termination...]
Will you marry me?
That's for the other box.
I cannot believe that Andy is throwing a party like this just to impress the CEO. Classic Gabe move. Hey Andy, how about you don't steal my business strategies, and I won't dress like my life is just one long brunch?
In the future, you need to get Michael's approval on anything before coming to me.
And what do we have here?
Wake up, Fred. The power cord on your Sabre printer shocked you into a coma, and you're dreaming you're a dog on a desert island.'
There's no way that you guys have any almond butter, right?
You're really going to like Bill. He, uh, he has me toilet a lot of people for him. [Dwight sighs, Gabe's phone rings] Hallway phone, Gabe Lewis speaking.
How would you compare, like, an accountant and HR?
My gym allows it. I wish they didn't, but it's policy. So I respect it, and I just--[put's his hands cupped by his face and turns away] keep a low--you know, I look away. Think about your commission cap as a naked old man in a gym locker room.
I love the burn. The burn is where I live.
Abe and Mary are seated watching the show. [in Lincoln voice] Oh Mary this is wonderful��� Ok Mary stop your scolding.  I���ll be quiet. [aside to the audience] I need her like I need a hole in the head! [scattered chuckles from the crowd] [Gabe raises his hand with a finger pointed in the shape of a gun to his head] BANG!  Ooh [Gabe falls to the ground and the crowd claps, Gabe picks up the Lincoln hat, bows, runs to the crowd and trades it back for his pink ���DM does GB��� hat and runs off]
Is this job really about the money for you, Jim? I mean, isn't this where you fell in love?
And I overheard, and thought, hey, that'd be fun, don't mind if I do.
And, uh, you will do your counseling right here, because our HR staff are all certified counselors.
Oh, thank God. I had a horrible nightmare that I was stuck in America with Gabe.'
I am as smooth as a porpoise. {Erin argues]
So, I won.
[makes buzzer sound] Too slow. It's the toilet. And I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. And, just like a toilet, I am essential.
What?
Good.
How much time do you have? Sales ability? None. Integrity? See sales ability. [makes a 'zero' hand gesture]
It's still on upstairs.
I know what it smells like but I didn't roll in anything. It's from listening to all of Gabe's bull[bleep]. [laughter] 'Isn't this the perfect romantic getaway, Erin? Sitting on a deserted island wearing dog costumes? I'm Gabe and I'm a weirdo.'
Michael, I don't want to incentivise murder. But - we've tried to make it clear that our policy emphasises sales staff -
Great.
Ok let me go get it.
Yeah, that would be awesome. I could get a girlfriend. Wouldn't have to go to Amsterdam seven times a year. But uh, I'm young, right?  I will date when I'm dead! [Laughs]
It's awful. [reaches for tissue box, hands it to Kevin]
Well he���s probably a drug dealer. That���s the best way to land a hot girlfriend. You just uh get her hooked on blow.
What happens if you're the hunchback?
Well, Jo--
The Sabre Code of Conduct outlines the governing principles key to establishing and maintaining trust with our employees, clients-
Beautiful sentiment.
Thank you all for meeting on such sort notice.
