Have you seen how Persians decorate? They will cover that bar in cheesy blue carpeting, white statues and gold curtain rods to the point that you will want to puke!

Girl bar? I never even knew there was such a place.

Yeah. And you know why? Because men are all assholes! They make you feel ashamed for being a little... big, or, manly looking.  But not Lesbos. We accept other women for who they are inside!

Because we're protecting the only home we have.
