We can't? I think it's pretty fun.

No, it's Les Bos!  We... are Lesbos! And as Lesbos, we cannot just stand and watch as one girl bar after another gets shut dowwwwwn!

Never!

We stand and fight! When the Persians come we tell them "We aren't leaving Les Bos."

You know, a long time ago when I first realized I was a lesbian, I felt isolated, confused. And finally I found a place that accepts me for who I am.

It's okay. There's people you can hire for this kind of thing.
