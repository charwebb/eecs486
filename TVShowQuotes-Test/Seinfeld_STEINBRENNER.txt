Alright, Wilhelm, listen to me. I want the stadium scoured. He could be bleeding to death in the bullpen.
Hello are you the bomber?
Costanza? Where's Costanza? . . . Excus mois? Have you seen Costanza?
Morgan, Morgan, you know his name is conspicuously absent from this card. Almost like he went out of his way not to sign it.
What's that figure ahead? Is that anything? Okay, let's check the desk. That's where I heard the ticking. Search each one of those drawers starting with the top one. So, empty calories and male curiosity, eh, Georgie?
We gotta get back to business!
Good, Merry Christmas George. And bring me back some of those cigars in the cedar boxes, you know the ones with the fancy rings? I love those fancy rings. They kind of distract you while you're smoking. The red and yellow are nice. It looks good against the brown of the cigar. The Maduro, I like the Maduro wrapper. The darker the better, that's what I say. Of course, the Claro's good too. That's more of a pale brown, almost like a milky coffee. (George exits) I find the ring size very confusing. They have it in centimeters which I don't really understand that well...
Costanza here is busting his ass on those hats.
Don't be so sure George. Mess with them and they're messing with you. All right boys send it in
Grubs, huh? Gotta admit, I never tasted one of those.
