My name is George Steinbrenner, I'm afraid I have some very sad new about your son.
Let me ask you something, George. You having any personal problems at home? Girl trouble, love trouble of any kind?
Well, Buhner was a good prospect, no question about it. But my baseball people love Ken Phelps' bat. They kept saying 'Ken Phelps, Ken Phelps'.
Of course. Of course it got done. Things get done all the time, I understand. (as George disappears) Don't worry, your job'll be waiting for you when you get back. (banging his fist on his desk) Get better George. Get better!
You know, she'd be better off making a sandwich at home and bringing it in. (picks up the telephone hand set) Hello, ah, George will you excuse me.
I couldn't look at a donut for the next two years. Well not that I was ever one for the sweets.
What's that figure ahead? Is that anything? Okay, let's check the desk. That's where I heard the ticking. Search each one of those drawers starting with the top one. So, empty calories and male curiosity, eh, Georgie?
You know George, it struck me today me that a Communistpipeline into the vast reservoir of Cuban baseball talent could be thegreatest thing ever to happen to this organization.
Yes yes George. Can you talk to me for a second? Of course you can -- Im a very accessible man. I just wanted to say you're doing great work on that Canola oil stuff.
Good morning to you, Wilhelm.
