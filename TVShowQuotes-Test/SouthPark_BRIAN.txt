Ms. Clinton, we just received word of a possible terrorist attack on your rally today.

No, I mean what kind of nuclear device?!

Wow! That's great! All right, come on in and take a seat; we're gonna have some fun!  All right now, I'm just gonna ask you a few questions. Just answer these questions as truthfully as you can, alright?  Okay. Number 1: Do you ever make remarks... which you later regret?

We ran the tests four times! We used four different E-meters!

Oho, that's just this thing: What's the Denver Broncos' record now? Six and two?
