[on phone] Hey, Andy. It's David. Still here. What was that about three months?
Dwight?
Will you be the new manager?
And I know we have a call scheduled for later ���
Good, very good.  See, told you.  Sounds like somebody had a good trip.
Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk?
Yeah.
Well, I gotta tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn���t even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals.
