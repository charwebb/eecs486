You can stay on as a salesman, Andy.
So Michael, do you think you can give me a run down on the Buffalo clients by Monday?
Thank you Michael, thanks, thanks everybody. I'd like to auction off a weekend at my place in Martha's Vineyard. Hey, hey!
How could you possibly think this is a good idea?
So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on.
