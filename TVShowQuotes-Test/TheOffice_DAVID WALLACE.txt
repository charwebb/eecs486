So you���you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting?
Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk?
Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please?
...No, you lied to me Andy. You pretended to be in this office for three months and you were sailing on your boat!
You could have burned down the whole building.
