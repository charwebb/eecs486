Where are you up to, with such a nice present, birthday party?
Oh, well, I really think I'm falling for you... [opens the playbill and flips five pages till he finds and reads autograph] .....Joseph Puglia...
And then last night, he put on my high heels. Oh, he put on such a show for us! He was dancing around, lip-sync'ing to ``A Chorus Line'', I mean you can see he's got talent.
Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone.
Well, I was going to say why don't you get off with me, but you're obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something.
So I got home, and he was vacuuming! I mean, he's twelve years old! Who else but my Alan would do something like that?
Excuse me, did you say turbo? Saab turbo nine-thousand? Is it... (voice breaking) midnight blue?
