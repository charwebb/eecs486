I could listen to you talk about mail all day.
Well, I'm his mother. (stern) Vincent, what's going on here?
Goin' on four years.
Who are you?
(Sitting behind George) You make your father sit here all day?
No, I mean what does 'ironic' mean?
What about a shooting star?
Where are you up to, with such a nice present, birthday party?
(Mesmerized with Kramer's body) No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point? (She sees Kramer emerge from another room. He's wearing only dress shoes, socks, and his briefs) My.. he's sexual, athletic.. an' without a trace of self-consciousness!
Yeah, it's in my purse.
I don't know.
So I got home, and he was vacuuming! I mean, he's twelve years old! Who else but my Alan would do something like that?
A thousand.
Get your hands off of me! Johnny!!! Johnny!
