Well, we couldn't find cancer, but we found a man with cancer.  Take that, cancer! And that! 
Crikey! Ol' Tugger looks healthy, happy, and  fit as a whistle!
Uh-oh, Tugger's whistle. You know what that means!
Tugger's whistle's blowin' 
Means we must be goin' 
No more Russell Crowein' for you.
But now don't you start to whine
I'll see ya again next time.
'Cause there's plenty a-more a-fightin' left to do.
Makin' movies, makin' songs, an' fightin' round the world.
See you next time, everybody!
