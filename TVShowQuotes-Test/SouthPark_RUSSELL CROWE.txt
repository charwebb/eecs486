...lets ask our old friend, Tugger. Where should we go fight people next, Tugger?

It's that God-damned editor! He cut the Brooklyn scene short! Tugger, I'm gonna get him!

Well?? You all just gonna stand there or are you gonna fight?  Crikey, you've done it now!

Tugger's in a bit of a sad state. Seems his girlfriend and him had a bit of a row last night.
