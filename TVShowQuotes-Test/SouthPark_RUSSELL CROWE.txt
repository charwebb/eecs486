...lets ask our old friend, Tugger. Where should we go fight people next, Tugger?

Who the hell do you think you are?!

You know that you're my baby. You know I need you now.

Great idea!  Tugger thinks we should go to the faaar away of China.  China is one of the oldest civilizations on earth. And from what I understand, they LOVE a good fight! So let's go!
