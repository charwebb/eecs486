So what does the ATF do when religious fanatics are gonna commit mass suicide?

Stand back, people. There's nothing to see here.

No, it's all me. Uh, my bad.

It is, too!

Oh. 

Hello, children. Dr. Mephesto needs one of you to help him out in his lab with the prehistoric ice man.

Keep your eyes peeled, boys. Somebody's gonna make love to this chicken any minute. 

Hooray!

B L O O uh oh-O spells "blue" and that means that you will go to the lab and help out Mephesto and then we can all go home and watch Murphy Brown. 

Come on, time to go home.

Oh, I like snakes. You light 'em and they grow and grow.

What's this all about?

Ahhh... O... O--

No! No! Hey, stop it!

What's going on back there?
