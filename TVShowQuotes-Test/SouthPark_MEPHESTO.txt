Ah! Here we see the ice man trying to gain Internet access on the computer. The Internet was still not very big in his time, so the Web frightens and confuses him.  It's okay, he can't hurt you.  It's one-way glass: he can't even see us.  And now the ice man watches television. 
Ohh. I'm sure it was my brother again. He tries to shoot me every month.
And here, of course, is my four assed ostrich.  And my four assed mongoose.
Means the turkeys are growing at an exponential rate. If we don't destroy them all, they'll take over the town. Maybe the world.
