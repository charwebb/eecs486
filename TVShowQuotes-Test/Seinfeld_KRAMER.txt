Oh you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the cocoa bean.
(entering Jerry's apartment, in his own tuxedo) Whoo! Boy. Yeah, you clean up nice.
(still outside) Helowwwowwow (Estelle opens the door) Hey (kisses Estelle hello) Ha ha, Good evening (George waves)
Well, I think one of us should leave.
It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it.
God!
Ah!!! Yahh!!!
I saw a couple of other guys out there.
(to Mickey) What about lifts?
And you're going to go out with her.
Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. (whistles) That guy's coming home in a body bag.
Oh, mama.
Fix what?
Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.
Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.
Oooooh ...Pops .... Wow!! Spectacular.
What, this is a party?
Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.
Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me.
You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in your head.
Hey. Well. (proffers the envelope) This was downstairs for you. Ker-ching.
The monkey.
No.
Ya.
Yeah, all right.
Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this.
Is that from Henry the Eighth?
Because it doesn't concern you.
Where are they?
I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you wanna come?
Exactly
"... with a broom, cleaning up."
Oh help me man, I'm desperate!
Oh, listen, I'll take that Tupperware now.
Great.
No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.
No, I want to speak to the manager.
Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
Look, Newman, I told you to let this thing go.
Well, Elaine Benes! Well, it's great to have you! (Elaine sits down) Boy, is it possible that youre even more beautiful than the last time I saw you?
What?
Watch out!
Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks, air-conditioners, shopping carts (makes sound - fzup!), I just rolled 'em into the woods.
Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh! I know what I think. I think you're gaga over this dame. She's twisted you around her little finger, and now, you're willing to sell me, and Elaine, and whoever else you have to, right down the river.
So I listened to my katra and now <vreep> I'm dominating the dojo. I'm class champion.
If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I can make things very unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one.
You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!
Ah, 's no good.
Well I don't, I'm guessing.
Yeah, go ahead.
Elaine!
Keflon.
I have a pen.
No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants.
Yeah calzone.
Hey!
Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, cause I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out.
Oh, hey,
Hey, smell my arm... Smell it!
When can you park head first?
W..W..Wa...Wa..Wait..Wait wait.. Now lets videotape your head for the before picture, so we can watch how it grows and stuff. Sit down (George sits).....Lean back...A little bit to the right.
Do over  start with him.
Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated, hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws. (One of the homeless men starts to wander off, walking away) Now, I don't caer where you're from, or how you got here, or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit.
Alright, alright, fine. You take the monkey's side, alright, go ahead.
Hey, how ya doing?
whoa whoa ginga, you were supposed to tie the knot
Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name..
I'll get a ticket! Besides, what if somebody wants to get out of here?
So you'll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer shot - we hear Kramer, on the tape say 'Ah man, I sat in gum')
If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop.
All right I'll be back in a second. You guys coming to my party? (exits)
Hey, hey, hey. Look at that.
He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?'
Yeah.
I know what I'm gonna say.
Yeah, I like him. Hey Jerry, what time you got?
Hey!
Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. That's not right.
Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a (Snaps his fingers in rhythm with his words) lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog (Stops snapping) - all on the same day.
He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it.
Yeah.
Yeah, nothing. We're still following him.
No, no, she got up, she walked around...
Ah, Mr. Weatherbee.
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?
Hello, twelve dollars.
Price club.
Thanks. Have a good day.
So, how long you been drivin' this thing?
You wanna keep your job don't you?
Hello boys, (in an Irish accent) top of the morning to ya. What do you say?
Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and uh well Joe doesn't want my business.
I don't know.
No, no. She put a stop to that.
And Newman gave you money too. So, I didn't even meet this guy. You know, we trusted you.
No, no, no. It's not the sex, Jerry. (noticing Morty and Helen) Heyy! Seinfelds.
Wellll, isn't it obvious?
I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.
uh..
Yeah?
No, that's yours. My half is gone.
So maybe I'll go down there and watch, uh? She'll be there, ,maybe.
Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.
Wide open!
Well, what am I gonna do?
They gave them all to Goodwill.
Well, just save me a seat.
Now that's impossible.
What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?
Gawd!!!
About two hours.
1937.
Hey.
See you later. (He promptly turns and leaves)
(hesitant) I uh, I was thinking maybe I should spend the night.
Got a minute?
Yeah, your phone is line one.
These are my friends Jerry and Elaine.
(entering, handing Jerry a piece of paper) This was in front of your door.
No no you know we're not partners. I only get twenty-five percent.
George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.
Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?
Uh. Jerry. These nosebleeds are starting again.
Hola, Jerry! I'm into this Puerto Rican day! The sights! The sounds! The hot, spicy flavor of it all! It's caliente, Jerry!
Yeah. They were..quite taken with it.
Yeah, yeah.
What do you mean?
Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy.
She says she wants those shoes.
Um hm.
Uh, I just want to say I think you're wonderful.
uptown, to the Y
(entering) Hey.
I want restitution.
It's Jell-O.
Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing.
Alright, so what happened when you saw him?
Let me smell you.
Yeah. Oh, here, wait wait (walks a few steps to catch up to her as she stops) Ah, maybe you could ah, use this (he searches through his jacket) Ah, here, it's a electronic organizer...
Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!
Yeye cat fight!
Well I didn't hear any Plus.
(to Elaine) You want some hot tea?
Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!
I got it. Yep.
Okay, look, uh, when you're in Florida, can my cigar guy drop off some Cubans for me at your parents' house?
Well because I meet a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. I mean why do you think my mother went out with him?
what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?
Now that you mention it , a little woozy.
Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I *still* got time to catch him!
From who?
(simultaneous) Wait a minute, on the cover I'm...
I'm not, I'm running it.
Hey, Morty.
(whose voice has returned to normal)" THE VELVET FOG!!!!"
(To Mr. Abbott) How ya doing?
(to the gang) There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.
You see?
I don't know.
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.
Give me it..( tries to pull them off George's head)
(Like a parent) Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him.
You must be Aaron, I've heard about you.
Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.
Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite.
Hi. Ahh...these are soft seats.
12,000 BTU's.
Like a history of coffee tables, celebrities and their coffee tables. It's a natural. This is a story that must be told.
No. They put the top on.
Oh yeah, I got a big appetite.
Happy birthday paruba!
That's all I got.
No, no. No doctors.
Yeah.
(Looking over Mickey's shoulder at the script) Yeah, well, I was a different man then.
I love her!
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.
Hi.
Yeah (to buzzer)
Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre?
...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
Yeah, maybe I can get some rubber gloves there huh, yea.
Well, why?
For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you.
Really?
"Well.. Aye can't hold the water."
(To Elaine, muffled, low, and threatening) Elaine, you want to stop?
...so I said to him Arthur, Artie come on, why does the salesman have to die? Change the title; The life of a salesman. That's what people want to see.
Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?
(at the same time) Yes, yes.
Oh...four. (to waitress) Yeah, could I have a cup o'tea? Boiling hot.
alright.. George you got it? (gives him the rope)
Yeah, Yeah...Why, is it too cold out?
So, what's George doing?
All right, where you going?
Oughh!
Look at hose babies [hands]. They're prunes. I saw Conrad going up to oyur place.
(convulses in pain) Yeow! Whoa.
(after delicately sniffing Elaine) Uh... that's not bad at all.
What, Mr. Marbles? He's harmless.
Yeah, he was.
By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.
Thats for me. (to the phone) Kramerica Industries. Oh, hi, Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie...
Oh, I can wait..
Why don't ya' leave?
I parked in front of that restaurant . As soon as this race is over I got to go to the airport.
Ya.
Well, why don't you do your material?
Well, I'm off to the links.
Whoo. Wrong car. Sorry.
Oh yeah. Home-made pies, two hundred yards back.
No, we're in the same class.
So, what do you think? Does this work?
C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.
Hey, Seinfelds!
Im gonna go down there and try and talk to her.
Ashtrays?
How do those lifts feel?
Uh, Swiss.
yeah yeah
Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling like this only happens once a year.
Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the...
No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled.
(clapping Jerry on the back) Oh yeah, he's all ready to go.
You got a problem with Woody Woodpecker?
(to Jerry) Well at least let me audition.
Hey buddy.
George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. (leaves)
Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?
Hey.
(bangs arm of couch in frustration) You peeked!
(handing Jerry & George a flyer) Good morning, gentlemen.
I'll take it.
(pointing to the largest one) Now, what is this?
Oh, I just had two double-fudge sundaes.
What about my massage?
I I I
(singing) yodel lay hee hoo! yodel lay hee hoo! hello! (Kramer jumps around George from one side to an other)
I say Japan.
(enters apartment, points at Jerry) Hey, what are you doing later?
Yeah.
Well, I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt.
I'm gonna put it down behind that car.
"Well he said that humm.. you know.that it helps his pathients relax a little bit..and he's got a new polithy Adults only."
Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys? Let's pause a moment. (Newman starts the taped music) Jerry, now, what you do with your personal life is your business, but when you're on my set - you clean it up, mister!
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?
Yeah.
I go in front first all the time.
But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films.
Oh, he's a tomcat.
Wait a second, he's getting off. Yeah, he's gonna be going south on the one-thirty-five.
So long. I'll see you tonight.
Oh I accept.
Look at you.
(to George) Hey buddy.
There was an incident.
Well, I knew him as well as she did.
h-Yeah...
" Hmm! Oh! Yeah. I'll tell you who is an attractive man; Gorge Will."
Well that's stupid
I told you! Now, Frank, listen. Here's what I'm thinking. Now, you have a friend in the bra business, right?
Ah, you remember.
"Well apparently I do something 'cause I'm sitting at the head table with Mr. Mel Torm
I know where I?m standing.
Anything you wish. I'll tell you a little secret about zip codes They're meaningless! (Laughs evilly, driving away)
Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it.
It's Grossbard!
Okay.
(seeing Newman pull up along side him in his truck) Hey.
Last week. When I, you know, gave you the phone. Hes really into my pizza place idea!
Hey.
Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!
Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station. (shrill) What's going on!?
(reading) sobs
No Jerry! I - I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken. Now you leave those roasters alone. Kenny never hurt anybody.
Okay.
I still like to stop at the duty free shop.
(Quietly) Buffer zone (Kramer moves to the other seat)
Sounds like a nice girl. Hey Jerry, is it all right if I put some stuff in your fridge? 'Cause mine's full.
Elaine. Uh, you got a moment?
I'm calling the shots around here so there won't be anymore ACCIDENTS!
Well, is it good?
I can't get my pants off, and Mickey's audition is in twenty minutes! You know, I'm supposed to be a business man, I gotta be in costume!
Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.
Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other hand he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?
Well I thought it was so your parents wouldn't walk in while you're with a girl.
Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you, you're a word man. Alright, let's go deeper. Uh, what kind of man are you? Well, you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations, but what tempts you?
I thought you took the test.
Uh, you need any help, or..?
Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't have the problems we have in the world today. Well, you don't rob somebody, if you know their name!
Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River. I think it might be polluted.
Why?
Yeah. See ou later..
So you'll buy them?
Saved a fortune. Look at that. Heyy.
Hey boss.
Each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.
Yeah, I bought a chicken.
No. (To manager of H&H) Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.
Oh, yeah. Top floor. (sits beside Frank) Listen, Frank, have you ever considered wearing something for support? Now, look at this. (reaches into his pocket) Mind you, this is just a prototype.
Well, I, uh, I borrowed it last night and it got a little dirty.
Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished "oink" of pig-man cries out for help.
I'm down.
(Spraying his flowers) Hello, neighbor.
Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?
Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute.
Its three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..
Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.
Yes, It's a fine day
Well, we talked about a lot of things.
You got a pen?
(entering the condo, and going to the fridge as if he's a neighbor) Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?
Yeah, from my peephole. Fisheye, sees all.
All right. What if I tell Paul O'Neill to hit a home run tomorrow, just for you.
Well, where the meat goes?
It's the only way you'll learn. (Tastes his eggs.) Aw, these eggs are disgusting. This chicken should be ashamed of himself.
Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can't have. Oh, this is tantamount to a slap in the face.
No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet.
Whats this?
pig-man, baby. pig-man.
No, you'll never get a better deal than that.
Cosmo, go. No, no, na, na. (he pushes the end button and pushes the antenna down) Boy this new telephone number's driving me crazy -- wrong numbers, every five minutes.
A golf tee. In the dry cleaner.
Hmm. Why you takin' an IQ test?
Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be $50,000
They're Geoffrey Haarwood's.
No, thank you. So what are you doing?
Wonder what's goin' on.
(impressed) Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.
How much do you make?
Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my katra.
Genderson's.
All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.
This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.
I know what this is about Father. I didnt do anything. I just spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. Its just that, that I have this power.
(impatient sigh) You don't have a problem.
That guy.. He was just...
Serenity now, serenity now...
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
Who are you talkin about?
Ya
No, I fled the scene.
Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be spicy. Yeah, George bring him over.
We're putting in cable.
The woman is a menace.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.
Do you recognize it? ... The beach.
What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque.
You mind if I use it in my book?
Well, I don't have this kind of cash.
Hey! They hooked me up.
Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should settle this.
Right.
All right, I've had it with you two. (opens apartment door to leave)
Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on.
Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider.
She's fat.
Well, thank you.
Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you're crazy!
What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.
Are you through?
Get extra MSG.
All right, look. I'm going to be honest. I'm very interested in the van.
Yea.
Aahh, this looks familiar
All right.
What?
Hey, you got any Double Crunch?
Bulimic,
... Uh, go ahead, yeah. (listens and makes a note) Alright uh... Yeah, yeah, okay... I look forward to it too. (listens) Eh, hah, okay. So long.
I tried bran-- 40%, 50% 100%. The bran isn't working for me.
People do, I don't.
I bet.
(Laughing) What is that, a new bit?
yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though.
An hour and a half!!! I was reading a manuscript, I just couldn't put it down.
Um, yeah. (glances around the apt.) Oh, uh ... well, how's everything? (clap)
That musta been some kind of doll.
Me and Lola....
Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, uh Regis... actually, this is a true story. I umm I was skiing at the time.
"You should take cold showers."
Just be yourselves. ( Elaine plays with her hair flirtingly)
Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!
So...you're the Assman.
No buts. His apartment tonight, Eight o'clock.
They should be sent to Australia.
Hey! (indicating photos) So what d'you think? You like it?
(to the ticket man) Uh, yeah, a ticket for Kramer.
Oh, yeah, yeah, you were, you were very good.
"Yeah! well ..that's the guy .He's organizing the dinner."
Theres no dinner. The bets off. Im not gonna do it.
What you didn't think I was really laughing?
Why? Why? Look, I paid for her. (Jerry stops walking)
Relax, Silvio.
Is too.
What am I gonna say?
hey guy, can I use your phone in your bedroom?
I like that eye patch.
Yeah. So long, Morty.
(quietly) Ohh (Eyeing Jerry's empty apartment) Really?
(Shrugging Jerry off) Nah.
Hey, Silvio!
Fling!
Shh, shh.
AAH! AAGH!
You dont?
I think I gotta go to the doctor! (exits) Oh, mama!
Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice. (Vet gives him a look) I mean, uh.. dog food.. juice. (Adding) What's worse - he has a nagging cough. (Smucker's coughs) Yeah, that's it. That's it.
Hey Maestro!
I hate KEITH HERNANDEZ - hate him.
Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans.
But what am I gonna do for fruit?
The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth.
Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?
(pacing back and forth) Ya.
Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.
Why can't I play Kramer?
George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the dance. She sends you an enticing photo, you send her one right back.
(dismissive) Ahh.
Oh! That's Newman. (goes over to the window)
Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there.
And you're saying she's deaf.
(fearful) There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes.
yeah
Oh, uh, Nana. Hello.
OH YEAH! ALL RIGHT!
Well, he thinks you wear those.
Well, I gotta have a central nervous system.
Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office..
Now, I can't see..... Psst.... Psst...
Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.
Yeah, don't I know it.
George?
There's no water pressure.
Maybe I will.
What time is it?
Hey hold that bus!
Jerry, how about you?
So...how was the dinner last night?
Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour.
(takes another smell of his hands) Alright I gotta a ten o'clock, I'll see everybody later.
You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream.
Oh, Ive been in the slash many times. This is nothing. Youll get used to it. Just, (Makes a popping sound) put it out of your mind.
Well, then, he's out!
Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe.
Hey! Couch is comin.'
Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy.
Is it over four hundred?
Oh, hi. I uh just came to say goodbye.
Jimmy leg.
Well, you gotta pick it up for me!
You got anything to drink? Agua?
Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.
Well, that was alright, huh?
Darren is going away for a long long time.
...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww.
What?
I gust met Uma Therman. She's giving me her telephone number. Uma Jerry, Uma.
rock
Kavorka?
HeYAWaaa
He just sunk like a stone.
Elaine, you should be there to document it.
(from inside Jerry's apartment) OK! (door opens)
Kramer.
So, there were a lot of people there, huh?
She has delicate beauty.
It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for ya.
I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees. I can't get my core temperature back up!
You just gotta mention my name.
We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper with it.
I got a stone.
Hes a go getter!
Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go. (Heads for the door)
Hey.
Hes in the music business.
Probably. Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.
Good for you.
No, no I can't comprehend it?
Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!
Oh Come on Jerry, It's all the way over to twelfth avenue..
Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?
Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!
Because he's scared, Jerry.
Oh, it's uh, it's a bold adventure.
I take baths.
Okay (lifting the bag and carrying it into the apt.)
Okay, I beg you.
Where? Where?
Well, I couldn't find my shoes.
So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
(Bracing himself on a bar stool) Yeah, I already did it. It won't come off. The zipper's suck..
"(gasp_)......Kom Pau........"
(to Joel) Its gonna be hot in a minute.
See that was nice, Jerry. (under breath) Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.
Well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway becomes a two-lane comfort cruise. (to Jerry) So, you got any black paint?
Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?
Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?
(relaxing) ...oooohhh yeeaaah... aaahhh... (he is really enjoying this)
Alright.
(eating some nachos) Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?
I dont know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I havent been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. Im clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right?
(to the exiting Elaine) Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there, (following her out the door) maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses. (shouting after her) Elaine!
Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is. (he takes pieces for himself and Jerry)
Oh Movie Phone.
EVIL, eye.
Yeah. Be right back. (Kramer leaves)
What is this, parsley?
And laughter is the best medicine.
Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the air.
Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.
And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th President, was the man they most admired.
Well, it's the style. (turns back to Jerry) Jerry give me the keys. (Jerry throws his keys to Kramer) Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that.
Well so she faked 'em, so what?
Whoh!
It'll take you ten seconds.
A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.
Hey buddy. I am waiting for my shirt.
Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that.
No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke "the covenant of the keys."
Davola?
Since when are you so trendy?
"He..he... When they pull that needle out I let the expletives fly."
The little man knows all.
I got carpool. (exits)
(Closing door) The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Why did you get rid of that sausage?
(throwing his catalogs in the Pottery Barn store) Hey, you like sending out catalogs!? How do you like gettin' 'em back!?
What?
Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already.
Well, there is something you can do.
Yeah, my mind's a blank, I'm sorta nervous, you know, uh...
Feel it. Feel it.
Yeah, it's baked on in. Hey, put another stick of butter in.
(on the phone in the shower) Lomez, you're not listenin'. Jerry likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. Calm down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, I'll call ya back.
Oh yeah! It's you!
A big dinner with dessert. But Ive got till the end of the month.
You know, maybe in Korean "dog" isn't an insult. Could be like the word "fox" to us. Oh, she's a DOG!
(in the shower, reading an instruction manual) Installing your Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot. Oh, come on, Clarkman.
(to George) You , you know what you should've done is watching that report on CNN last night.
My whole lot?
But I want to--
All right, I'll see you later.
Well, you too seem to have the same taste.
Uh yeah. It's under the couch.
That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up.
I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky yourself, buddy.
The sand, it's everywhere! (blows on his arm)
Oh, uh, uh. (Leaves)
Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair.
I told you I sold them to Bania.
Im not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it.
Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is your chance to make it all right again.
For you he would.
Its a simple job. Why, you dont think I can?
Okay, okay, what is it? Come on.
Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. (Introducing each one) This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto.
So, you sleep in separate beds.
Id give him 24 hours to get out of it. They cant get out of it in 24 hours, its a land rush.
Oh, I keep getting these nosebleeds.
Come on, take some. It's good.
So what's going on, how did all this happen?
huh.. my batteries are dead
(Stretching) Oh..
Whew, chicks man. Too many chicks know my number.
Eleven, corner pocket. (Pulls back on his stick, accidentally crashing it into the window)
wow
Hey, Are you going to the hospital now?
Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real grove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through a flabby armed spanking machine.
Done!
Sand, I can get rid of the sand. (he sits at the table, looking down his shirt) Look theres still some in here, it won't go away! Look I even got sand in the pockets!
Really?
Now listen, Jerry, I'm gonna need you to testify.
Congratulations, Mr. Puppet Master.
I'll tell you how much I make.
Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m.
How much?
Newman. (Kramer smacks Newmans arm)
Hey Morty! (to Jerry) Salad dressing?
Well, that's only uh, 58 years.
Elaine!
Well, I heard that you have a very uh, special birthday card .with all the Yankee autographs on it.
(reasoning) We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!
Tell me about it!
(fidgety) Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh.
Uh, no.
Well, I feel that it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while...
Oh yeah, Im here to pick up my friend George Costanza.
Lomez, he sold me his hot tub.
I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the building.
O'Brien.
How tall are you?
This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last.
You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily.
Yes.
The Ball, silly.
What?
(quiet) Okay.
Why don't you take a handicap spot...
Me?
Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine.
Forget it.
Well, you're going over there.
You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away.
Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era.
Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.
No way!
No, y'know we took the old man's records over to Ron's and he tried to *screw* us so we got in a fight.
..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts the door behind him)
Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something.
(enters) Well... I've had it with these jackbooted thugs!
Well, I'm not leaving the premises without tote bags. I was promised tote bags and tote bags I shall have.
It will be a funky adventure.
Oh, there's action. There's plenty of action. That damned alien autopsy is stealing all the headlines.
Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating, soothing your every aching muscle. The water's gonna get over 120 degrees! (happy)
Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?
That's the idea.
No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.
So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them turned brown! Well I followed the instructions!
It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your swing joints.
I don't know, we have a certain chemistry
God.
Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap.
Newman! (Elbows him through the books. Newman falls over.)
hey
Oh, hey.
See, the other thing is, if you dont like anything, he takes it right back.
Donna!
Yes, I'm free. (singing) 'cause the murderer struck again!
Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible.
No, no.
Yeah.
Have you seen George?
Moles, yes. Freckle's ugly cousin.
Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.
(Getting Pulled and pulled) I...um...ei...
Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a premiere.
Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!
Not as many as there used to be.
So whats going on between you and Gina?
I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson
Newman?
Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.
I thought we would blend in.
(whimper) Jerry?
(to 'mental phone') Oh, you wanna talk to Jerry?
I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. I don't recognize anybody. I miss home, and I don't even know how to get there.
Oh, yeah, that's...
But she really looks like a Lily
Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?
Oh, Jerry, what are you waiting for?
Nothing Nothing.
Oh You are so freaking talented.
Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...
The cops? What are you calling the cops for? They?re not going to do anything!
All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?
(To Assistant) Hey, you have keys?
Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue! (Elaine laughs) Boy, you wouldn't last a DAY in the Army.
Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and then Jerry, tipped him off.
So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off and bought this cafe latte.
Wait a second....
Wait, wait hold on now, wait, wait *bang* (he slams his hand down on the table, startling Jerry, Elaine and George) *bang* (again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip* *yip* See? I told you.
Yeah, it's, uh, me.
And it could be done.
Well, you better get on the horn.
Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing?
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. ((takes a swig and reacts))
Well you're not exactly zeroing in yourself, lady.
...sluggish.
What's going on?
Oh, geez..
No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.
I guess she was hot.
