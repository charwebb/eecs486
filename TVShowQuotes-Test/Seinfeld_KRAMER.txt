You should just eat fruit.
Oh boy. Woop...
Hey, how are you doing? Jerry! George!
Well we're in the country and we're right on his tail.
Yeah, what time is it?
No (throws hand in the air and turns and looks back at Jerry)
Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very emotional.
Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you believe this Maestro?
Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing.
(Snaps his fingers) Anatoly! (The Russians get to work on command. To Elaine) Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on Lifetime.
Oh. Well, would you look at that. (puts a gun-shaped hand to his head and goes 'Pop') I guess I forgot to lock it.
Mmm
Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!
(sighs) All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him.
(seeing Newman pull up along side him in his truck) Hey.
(Adding) Jerry, she's a loser. (George points to Kramer - gesturing that he's right on target)
I left a Macanaw peach in your refrigerator.
I didn't push you. How much did you pay that guy?
"Hey! Got the new Penthouse"
You shut up!
Now are you going to be here in an hour?
I do?
Watch out!
Yeah. Joe DiMaggio.
Damn!
Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it.
Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher.
You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah.
Who is it?
Ah!! I found a quarter. Anybody want there clothes heated up?
Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.
Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here?
So, what are you saying?
You're making a big mistake.
I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because I have no Tupperware.
Let me smell you.
Elaine. Uh, you got a moment?
Mint?
I'm not going if he's going.
Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.
See, that's why I don't want to.
Uh, Pantene.
No. And now I can't get it back.
Bugger!
Hey, everything my man.
(dismayed) So what am I in this for? You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. (is tearing up)
Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.
(George takes off the hat , he's got that cream on again) Pheeewwww! Boy! You stink.
Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works over at the police station. He's a composite artist.
Jerry?
Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one coffee drinker on that jury, (in a very high voice) I'm gonna be a rich man.
My friend he's a conductor.
It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushions didn't have any fabric on it.
What about my massage?
Yes.
Hello, I'm Kramer.
That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN.
(to tourists) Hey, are you folks from Japan.
Pisano's. That's the place by the stadium right?
Well, I got gonorrhea.
Mary Hart!
All right lets take a look to see what we got ( examines George's head) Wait a second.. I think I see something here George. Lets go to the videotape.
Well, I was just--
No! I'm not the Assman.
No, I can't, all right I can't ...
Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before.
Oh, he's the best...and the worst.
Well, that's only uh, 58 years.
(rolling the dice) Yeah. I am taking over South America and there ain't nothing you can do about it.
No.
I won't!
Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.
If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. I'm not Kramer.
I don't know.
Well that's stupid
Ma!
No, I read an article in Bon Appetit magazine. (grabs a baster) I'll see you later.
What! (Kramer is back to his usual way of speaking)
Well, (rubs hands) I gotta meet Newman at the pet store. Helping him pick out a turtle.
Oh, yeah. Top floor. (sits beside Frank) Listen, Frank, have you ever considered wearing something for support? Now, look at this. (reaches into his pocket) Mind you, this is just a prototype.
Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.
What's that?
Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.
(laughs too loudly) All right, let's take a short break.
Well, you know, ... it was an accident.
Yes
No job. No women.
Hey, what kind of stuff are you listening to? You *embarrassed* me at that store.
Aah! Aah! Mama!
Ah, 's no good.
It's Marion's poetry. I can't take it (leaves sobbing)
Uh, did you?
Hey, Jerry! Listen, I need you to come downstairs, help me get my stuff outta the car.
Oh you'll be ok. I'll see you later.
I told you, I threw it out.
No, no, no.
(quickly) Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.
Hey, how ya doing?
(Tears out another eyelash) Ah! (Blows it away)
Is this a joke?
Bet? Um, not betting.
What happened?
Alright, put a little sauce on here... (speaks some unintelligible words in an Italian accent while spreading the sauce around.) Some cheese...
Yeah.
Uh, no, see, my friend already bought me a ticket. I'm late, and she's inside.
Got the paper?
(listens) ...Well, I suppose I could, (turns away from Elaine) but I'd have to shift a few things around, uhm... Hold on for a second, will you? Uh...
Yeah-yah.
Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice.
They moved in together?
So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing it out for me.
Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know, (makes a noise) they block it! So, I lunged for the bathroom. (demonstrates) I grab the knob - Occupado! Then they back me up agains the cartoon map of Italy, and all of the sudden, they just stop.
Now listen, Jerry, I'm gonna need you to testify.
What's going on?
(from the other side of the door) Police! Open up!
Hey, is that T-bone?!
I want restitution.
Hey, Clyde!
(indicating the cereal) Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking on these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box.
Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.
"Ah! what.. Tim Whatley?
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut. How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years. All right, eh. (heading in)
In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!
What, this is a party?
Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.
How often do you cut your toe nails?
Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?
Oh, well I guess she found some place better to go.
C'mon, retrace your steps. What d'you do today?
(leafing through Jerry's mail) Oh, who sent you a card?
Phwap, I wouldn't even think about it.
Oh, I just had two double-fudge sundaes.
Hey, what are you gonna see?
There's Marcelino. (Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge white rooster.)
Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre?
Okay...
A big phone. A big one.
Yeah.
Wha--
No.
The Maestro.
Ah, the I.P.M.P.C.W.
No.
You can move in with me, if you want.
No I'm afraid I couldn't do that.
Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.
Yes! Oh look at this, these mangos are beautiful! Oh these are beautiful, (smells them) you did good George.
(TO GEORGE) Pink eleven. Remember that.
Uh, well there was an incident.
Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. (Pulls it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.
What's that?
Uh? Voila.
Ohh, it's real.
Well if they're lucky.
Oh, shh, Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place.
Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing.
You know, I cant believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you couldve invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.
Yeahh. I owe you one.
Oh, yeah, yeah, you were, you were very good.
Come on ,c'mon i need to taste it. ( takes his peach).....Nothin' , Can't even taste a Macanaw.
Oh come on Jerry, its opening night, black tie, Pagliacci! The great clown, the great sad tragic clown, like you.
You know all those stores canceled out on her? She's finished. (Concluding) We're (Leslie and him) finished.
Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple. (He exits)
(high pitched voice) "Well women do it." I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you can just (high pitched voice) sashey your pretty little self around the town square.
What do you think, Stan?
Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?
This mango is delicious!
(to Jerry) Hey buddy.
(enters apartment, holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! (inserts tape into VCR, sets up TV)
(acting very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. (pause, stops acting) Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?
I just found a guy whos willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.
Okay , all right. I'm gonna take a look at this huh!.( leaves)
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!
Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that.
No.
Duty.
(quiet) Oh.
(CALLING OUT) Jerry!
Now calm down, Mr. Fields...
Yeah.
Well, it's a valuable appendage.
(continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.
Oh. Well listen, I almost forgot to ask you. What happened at the funeral? Now, did you talk to Alec berg?
Jerry's teasing. Uh-oh! Commercial. Oh, you going to the bathroom? Yeah. I'll go, too.
They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment.
Yeah.
(looking at a map) I don't know. (over the speaker) Uh, no more questions.
T.C.B. You know, takin' care o' business. Aa--I gotta go.
Its funny.
Well, Ill think of something.
He is just setting the record straight.
In my spare time. (turns to George). You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual.
Better get that
Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.
Cosmo Kramer.. strikes over.
That's right.
(with his forehead in his hands) Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later?
Well, that is strange.
(grabbing the sweater) Yeah.
No way I'm taking fifteen.
Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally like this, usually I'm very cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate that you happened to be here at the same time as me.
Would you?
Yup, yup!
(enters) Well... I've had it with these jackbooted thugs!
Aah, Jerry I'm not gonna let you bring me down from this high. I've been partying all night. I saw the sunrise at Liza's!
[still lost] I know that guy...
I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff...
The bathroom scene. (moves his knows as you would if you sniffed)
Jerry, what are you doing? George tells me you're gonna throw your set?
*Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone?
Hey, how did you know about the guy in the park?
What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody)
(Keamer's voice starts slurring again) "Yeah! My lips swollen?"
(low tone)Yeahhehehehe
I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.
There, there's your hives.
How could you not think about it?
I'm so tired!
Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight at six.
Yeah? It's my Chinese food.
Well, that guy who yelled out.
Yea.
Ah you bit me. Get off of me, get off of me!
Spleenectomy.
Hey! wait a second. You didn't say hello.
That's East River.
You're just out for sex!!
Thanks, buddy.
I...I...
Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.
Yeah, Cupids Rifle -- 830, Sony Lincoln Square. Yeah, no, no, no, no problem, yeah.
(yielding) Okay, okay. What time?
Yeah.
Well, she's Jerry's girlfriend.
Wait a minute I need those keys. I wont be able to get into my apartment.
(smiles) Oh. Oh, Marlene...
Hi, Mike.
You see what happens when you try to be nice?
Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like yourself. (Elaine enters)
(to Jerry) Well, if youre just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.
Two and a half points.
Hey, you got any matches?
(Stopping his thought) Da-da-da-da no.
Hey, Dwayny.
Hey, I'm under fire here. (another club hits) I'm under heavy fire here, boy. (another hit) Jeez! That was a five-iron!
The sand, it's everywhere! (blows on his arm)
"What d'you got there?"
Didnt Elaine call you?
This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!
Buddy Hackett?
He Jerry, I'm going to waldenbooks.
What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.
You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free.
Okay.
Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider.
Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?
I got down in my knees and went, "Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, I love you!"
I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?
Yeah, Bob Saccamano's father.
Any mustard? This is empty.
Yeah. All right one chart coming up.
Hey, I'm tellin ya the pig-man is alive. The government has been experimenting with pig-men since the fifties.
So, what do you think?
I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long, and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this look. (faking to slurp spaghetti) Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down... (waitress comes to take the order) Bran lakes...100%. I got a big problem.
Oh, come on, Jerry! Come on, this is stupid! It's six o'clock! It's all over, just pick up the phone and thank him!
Will you tape it?
Hey.
What do you think?
What did you do?
Alright.. How do you like this? (Pulls out one of his eyebrows) Ya!
Hi, little buddy.
Oh, lots of 'em.
I'm in here. C'mon...
How much?
Its all manipulated with junk bonds. You cant win.
I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?
Well, why didn't you tell me about this?
Ooh Mama...( walks away)
I haven't made a bet in three years, I-
Yo-yo Ma!
I told you this is all I got.
Evidently. (To Elaine) Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them.
Hey.
Mmmmm.
...Steve. (to Jerry) Ah, you see?
What, again with you?
This is tomato juice, look...(drinks from the bottle.)
Well, what, they got any golf courses up there?
Uh-huh.
You want these? Knee socks. You dont wear knee socks.
I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume.
Hey, spice. (gives Elaine a piece of meat.) Welcome to flavor country.
Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.
I thought we were friends...
Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.
Ah, Tony, he's good.
Feel it. Feel it.
Joey, there you are. Hey
She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.
What about me?
Am I? Or am I so sane that you just blew your mind?
(Taking some of Jerry's clothing over to the kitchen) I see..
Uh, I didn't see him.
ahh.....!!
(Patting George on the shoulder) He's a hell of a guy.
... so the ball takes of and I'm waiting for it to turn.
What? You're siding with management?!
Alright, lean forward, relax.
So, you're still master of your domain.
Yeah, well, let me clue you in on something. There isn't.
Yes, Sansei.
Well I just got it. Spector gave it to me , he's giving everything away...becoming a minimalist.
You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed birthday card that was inside.
Jerry, you gotta give him some credit. (starts rubbing a stick of Jerry's butter across his face) You're just being totally ridiculous. (keeps rubbing) I'll see you later buddy.
Goohhhhck.
Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other at our word, all is lost.
Hey.
You got it, buddy.
(pouring cereal) Oh yeah. Most important meal of the day.
Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at the Alex Theatre.
Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?
Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong!
Yeah!
Hey, man. Enjoy the food?
No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.
It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for ya.
Well, what am I gonna do?
Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership, and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone says, "Kramer and that other guy, oh, they went further to the left of the slash than anyone ever dreamed!"
Oh, you just bring it in sideways and (pop) hook it.
See that was nice, Jerry. (under breath) Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.
Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe.
Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna show you, and you'll never be the same.
Price club.
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. ((takes a swig and reacts))
Yeah.
Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like it.
Hey hey, whoa come on give me a hug...
So THAT's how it's going to be
Wait till that Uma smells this Uva.
No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.
I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating.
Not necessarily.
So, somehow the Bronzo (?) is reacting to the poison she's giving you.
Well, it's uh, common courtesy.
I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert.
Polio?
Nothing.
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.
Loan her the money. You can afford it.
"My wife has an inner ear infection."
(yelling up at Jerry) Hey Jerry.
...They'll saw through bone. Uuuuuuuing yutyutyutyutn naannnaaa [makes saw noises while gesturing over Roy's chest] You'll see what's *inside* bone...
Shes a sweet kid.
He's holistic, George. He's holistic.
All right. What if I tell Paul O'Neill to hit a home run tomorrow, just for you.
George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't give him the satisfaction.
(to George) Well listen See you later ..thanks for driving me by..
Mousse. I moussed up.
(pause) YEAHH!
Now this I like.
You ever get a woman pregnant?
(aggressive) Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?!
Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.
Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta Ive still got time to catch her.
Well, why not? I like cucumbers.
Now that's a great looking shirt! (Gets up, admiring the shirt) Aye Captain! (Growls like a pirate) Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect. (Walks around Jerry, inspecting the shirt) Look at it! It's fantastic!
All right, Ill get ya a Mounds bar. Keep the engine running.
You want a taste? It's Cappuccino.
Whoa, you're dating this woman?
No.
Just a few more squirts. Cause I gotta stay juicy.
From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you don't know me.
Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home.
Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired.
I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. It's like a ski lodge.
Ah, Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what?
Well, why?
How 'bout zero?
I want my vacuum cleaner!
Hey.
(lighting his own cigar) Well, that's very kind of you.
Yeah.
Oohh.
Alright, so he's gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh?
Not just someone. Jon Voight.
(holds up framed picture) There she blows! (throws paper around)
Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got these guys.
Ok.
Jimmy leg.
Oh, yeah. You know why? Because it's dinner time. And you know what you do at dinner?
Well , that's what led to Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
Hey
Oh, you're poo-pooing!
(claps hands) So ...
My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect.
Well, yeah, lets do it uh?
Oh yeah. Elaine was a fun project. I enjoyed working with her.
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.
[In Newman's ear] Alright, well be back, jack.
But Jackie--
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.
(out the window) Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!
(moody) Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends.
Yeah.
I got it. We'll kidnap him . and we'll drop him off Upstate and this way he won't bother you anymore and he won't get hurt.
Phew.
George, I'm in love with her!
Alright, alright. Fine George! Don't chip in! But some day, we're gonna be driving along, we're gonna look out the window, and see her crawling along 5th avenue! Is that what you want?
I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?
Nobody put a gun to your head.
Sand, I can get rid of the sand. (he sits at the table, looking down his shirt) Look theres still some in here, it won't go away! Look I even got sand in the pockets!
I like to strain the sauce.
Oh no, I don't think so.
It all right if I keep these here for a while? I'm having a New Year's Eve party.
Five bucks???
(looks at his shirt as if he had a tie on) Oh man, you got mustard on your tie!
Look I want thirty-five percent.
In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in men's fashion.. It's a, a puffy shirt. (Leslie mumbles to Kramer) Well, yeah, it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.
I'm distraught!?! Wooh-wooh-hoo!
Mickey
No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to get back at me.
Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's...
Whoa, man!
So how we doin' on time?
You could've introduced me.
Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'
Hoochie moochie. (haha)
Yeah? Eva?
Uh huh.
Oh! (turns on the Merv Griffin theme music) Heeeyy! Well, ladies and gentlemen! It's our good friend, George Costanza! What a surprise!
Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good combination.
(looks inside the car and gasps) Ohhh Sweet Maria. Hey! lets go.
Are you guys ready?
Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. Hes not going.
Hey, are you performing tomorrow?
Oh, alrighty uh...
Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their own moles. Freckles that cover two men.
Yeah. Sure. Sure.
Yeah, I'm sure it's all here. (puts in in his pocket) You know I was just admiring your coffee table, out there in the hall.
Would you be interested?
Jerry, I need another massage!
No, no I can't comprehend it?
I hear you.
Oh my!
Hey.
(exhales) Well, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?
Yeah, yeah.
Oh. All right. You don't know what your missing. I'm loving this Jerry. I am never putting on another piece of clothing unless it's straight out of the dryer.
Well, I was just trying to help out.
Yeah...
Newman, wait!
The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey) Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards.
Sounds like a nice girl. Hey Jerry, is it all right if I put some stuff in your fridge? 'Cause mine's full.
Hey.
It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate.
Yeah.
No. You got a point.
You know who you are? Even Steven
Yeah!
You got any Ipecac?
No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case.
Next week? How come it's takin' so long?
No you can't, Jerry.
It's very refreshing!
Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then again, I've been known to do a lot of things. (Waiter opens the counter which hits Kramer on the head) Cigarette?
Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?
I *love* the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette!
What's up?
Heeeeey...
Alright, alright. Look, Jerry, we gotta get down to PBS, PDQ.
(chuckles)
Well, I really miss the Bermuda Triangle.
Yeah calzone.
Nah, it's good for ya'. Retards the aging process.
Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?
If they're real, that's Rushdie.
Well, um, goodnight.
It's good suspension!
Oh, boy.
I dont know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I havent been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. Im clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right?
Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New York City.
The factory?
Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh. (notices the Urban Sombrero) What is that?
Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry, I really love her. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking.
Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.
Yeah.
All right.
you know I think you are in love with him
Im human.
Hey, buddy. How was career day?
Kavorka?
Oh, was he? Was he? I guess the cable man doesn't like to be kept waiting.
rock
People do, I don't.
Yeah, white meat. And if I see one piece of dark meat on there. It's your ass buster.
(being grabbed by the security officials) Hey!
Yeah, yeah. I know, I know.
I'm going upstairs.
Yeah, that's cool. Well, you gotta support your team.
Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.
It will be a funky adventure.
Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa!
What test?
Yeah.
You're not gonna say anything, you got that?
Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to tell.
Hi,
So you gonna use it?
Well that's not how she remembers it.
Well open the door, you get a better look.
Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left
Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car?
The cops? What are you calling the cops for? They?re not going to do anything!
Yeah.
Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.
(Angered) Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! (Leaning over the couch, he addresses George) Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?
Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!
Whoa. That's the guy that I told where the elevator was.
Need some more matches.
(on his way to the door) Oh, oh well say hello for me.
George, you're becoming one of the gliterratti
Hey.
Hey, listen, I gotta go somewhere.
Oh yes
Can do.
Is it? Look at this.
Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to.
Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?
Wait a minute, Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?
Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.
No, you dont have to challenge that. Thats a word. Thats a definite word.
Ooooh... You stink.
No.
Well, I didn't believe you.
YAH! No Buts
I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this.
Yeah there are a few seats still available.
She has delicate beauty.
Nah.
Mickey, Mickey he hooked me up. He's a member of the academy.
Hey.
Donna!
Open it, it's from Hallmark.
(putting briefcase down) You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.
Steady, steady, now calm yourself, come on, now get a hold of yourself,
Because *you're* silly. Get it? (hands the Fusilli to Jerry) Yeah...
Ellen. We, uh, broke up again.
Yeah, 5.
it's in my book - "Astonishing Tales of the Sea" 51 people died.
Done.
Oh, yeah--Sotheby's. Yeah. They make good cake.
You stubborn, stupid, silly man!
I wouldnt set foot in your house.
Alright listen to me, I got a great idea. Now, you're a heavy sleeper, right? Why don't we just switch apartments?
Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early.
Ge--
Jerry? Jerry!
What?
C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking about.
what?
Who you calling big ape? (pushes Mickey back)
(from his apartment) Hey, Jerry! Come here a sec!
Oh. Hello.
Ah, you're making too much of it.
(frustrated) Damn. I don't understand this. I've ditched every bottle and can, and we still can't gain. It's like we're...
Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh! I know what I think. I think you're gaga over this dame. She's twisted you around her little finger, and now, you're willing to sell me, and Elaine, and whoever else you have to, right down the river.
Jerry
(Showing pure irony) I just can't be with someone who's life is in complete disarray.
Here we go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!
Oh, uh, uh. (Leaves)
Let's see.. (studies them) oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (Turns to Jerry) masculine.
...Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.
Deal?
(holding bette) Don't worry Kramer is going to take care of everything. See,, I got you Pineapple. I saw Beaches last night for the fourth time (sings) "You are the wind"
(backing off) OK.
Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! (Laughs.)
Me?
Yeah, yeah, chew on that.
You know what I'm gonna do? (heading for the door) I'm gonna return this.
Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.
(opening the door) Alright. I'll get that money for you in five minutes. And, don't eat any more.
Raquel Welch!
(showing Jerry his mailbox) Check it out. Rain and sleet may not stop them, but let's see them get by... these bricks.
Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay. I'm doin' this just for me.
You did.
Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?
Hey ah.
Cool it lady ( they struggle and we here a siren)
(chanting) yodel lay hee hoo
(To Jerry) So how was the big trip?
From The Hoffer-Mandale Clinic in Belgium.
Hey. (to Elaine) Hey how was your date with Phil Titola?
Well, it's the style. (turns back to Jerry) Jerry give me the keys. (Jerry throws his keys to Kramer) Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that.
I don't know!
(mumbles) b'd b'd
Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..
Bania, you're killing me.
Hey. Well, I just spoke to your girlfriend.
EVIL, eye.
Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?
Jerry...
Do you?
Hey, hey Jerry, come on. Sorry.
Yeah.
Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice of the fixin's bar.. garlic, (imitates the shaking of garlic onto a pizza) and what-not.. mmm, mmm.. and I see this guy over at the pizza boxes giving me the stink-eye. (Imitates the 'stink-eye') So I give hime the crook-eye back, (Imitates the 'crook-eye') you know.. Then, I notice that he's not alone! I'm taking on the entire Van Buren Boys!
No no, he's never met her. She's in California.
Hey Frank, you got two beds in here.
My mom Babs.
So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing.
Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball.
Of course its a good idea, its my idea. I conceived this whole project two years ago.
(regretfully) Uh.. I know I'm gonna regret this. (sigh) All right.
What the heck is going on here?
Get extra MSG.
My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit!
So Heather called?
alright, who's gonna tell her
Three quarters of a tank.
Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here in ten minutes.
D-d-d-d. I gotta switch shaving creams. I'm getting no protection.
Yeah, I'm going to poke around...
Orchestra, Row G, dead center, primo! You'll think you died and went to heaven.
Hey, where ya going?
Hey, you owe me. I got you into Actor's Studio. They thought what we did was the scene.
"Well I take 'em........They give me a Whooooosh."
Who's that?
Tell me about it!
(Smiling) You bet we are! Huh, Smuckers? (Smuckers coughs. They turn to leave) I'll see ya.
It was there!
(to Jean-Paul) Here, feel my hand. (takes off glove) Yeah, feel.
Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business.
Hey, what do you think they'll do to us?
I guess I screwed up!
Never said anything about the banking.
Yeah, it's a disturbing image.
Ah No no, I haven't.
Yeah, he was.
No, no. You're stoked. The camera loves stokedness. Look were not going to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. The key word is tasteful. Now I want you to relax and have fun because your a fun guy. All right let's do it. Okay come on. Feel the beat. Feel the beat. You know you got some real strong pecks but it's hard to tell under that T-shirt.
No, no, no, I didnt.
Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh!!!!!!
Independence Day?
Ahh! I'm out! No tape left!
It would put me at ease.
All right... Yeah. All right, have a good one.
Well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway becomes a two-lane comfort cruise. (to Jerry) So, you got any black paint?
Jerry Im so glad we switched apartments. It was a perfect solution.
Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta listen to the little man.
(pointing to Jerry) O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?
Yes, she's the costume designer and he's the wig master for the show.
No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? I mean, it was edgy, it was not my sort of thing but some of those people out there, they really liked it.
It's a business.
Oh, it's a birthday card.
Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough for you, buddy. And you too, Elaine, I haven't forgotten you.
You must be Aaron, I've heard about you.
Yeah well I went in there and they said Hey!
The Netherlands?
No kidding.
The add said that the bank's gonna pay a hundred dollars if you are not greeted with a hello
(Offended) What? No. That's disgusting..
I'm sorry. I mean, I know what it's like to be in love. Ties you up in knots. And Jerry is a very sexy man.
I'll do it.
Hey, fatso! I got a 90 in biology.
You're on, cowboy!
You've got a message buddy.
Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--
Okay. What are you getting?
Lindsay olives, Jerry.
Mile one-fourteen, clean as a whistle.
Fungus.
Oh, hello.
(Kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love. (Jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs it as he listens to Kramer) Every muscles she touches just... (long pause) ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy. (Jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch)
What's going on?!
Oooo, boy I've never seen these before (looking at the clothes George just sold Rudy)
Hey!
