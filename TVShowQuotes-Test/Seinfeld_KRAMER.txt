Oh, COME ON!
Only in The United States.
Yes I did.
Rock.
(To Brody) C'mon, let's go.
Ah, well I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live.
That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN.
She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious. (Elaine drinks some water and drools) She's foaming at the mouth!
What time do you need it at?
I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.
Aaaaah.
The sand, it's everywhere! (blows on his arm)
What?
Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant.
I'm going.
What?
Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally like this, usually I'm very cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate that you happened to be here at the same time as me.
(to Elaine) You better zip up. I couldn't get the top on the convertible up.
Hey!! Buddy. I thought of a great invention for driving. A periscope in a car, so you can see the traffic.
Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride.
Hey, Mrs. Seinfeld. Hi
What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?
Oh. Well listen, I almost forgot to ask you. What happened at the funeral? Now, did you talk to Alec berg?
Yeah. Move along, Betty.
Why, why? Why does she get it?
Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch, he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him.
(Shocked by the way Elaine looks) Yama - Hama! It's fright night!
Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line.
Ah, I'm glad you're here.
Elaine, you should be there to document it.
It's over!
It's not going to happen again!
"Whooo!"
I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the building.
You mean like the uneven parallel bars?
Sure!
You gotta come through with the hips first.
What are they doing here?
Yeah, thats Jerry, you dont have to worry about him. Why dont you go across the hall and get started on that mail.
(To Newman) See, we should've gotten some collateral from him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans.
Will you tape it?
Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.
What a body. Yeeaahh. Thats for me.
Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear.
(on the phone in Jerry's apartment) So when are you gonna be able to go out?
No problem there.
Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!
Hey. Well. (proffers the envelope) This was downstairs for you. Ker-ching.
Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?
And we're off.
How much?
Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no *fine touch*...
Is this a joke?
Back and to the left
It'll take you ten seconds.
Oh, there's leg work.
I think he looks fantastic.
Hey! (Group does likewise)
Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain perfectly creased.
Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job.
Oh you'll be ok. I'll see you later.
Nah.
Really.
No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock.
Well, how are we getting to Parsippany?
What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?
I saw the whole thing!
(agitated) I mean, it's killing me! Newman's got the jump on the invites, and will crush me if I try to go it alone!
Wha-- Oh, hey.
And I need something to write on.
Oh, tough crowd.
Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice?
I haven't made a bet in three years, I-
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
(singing) yodel lay hee hoo! yodel lay hee hoo! hello! (Kramer jumps around George from one side to an other)
That's a fallacy.
... Cou, ye, ge...
It stinks. Can you smell that?....You stink.
Oh, hey.
Im not happy about this.
Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go check it out.
Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me!
It's all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerry's)
what?
Patience.
George, I thought that was the door.
Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox.
All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out.
All right, Ill take it back. Im going by there.
You'd think...
Now, it's called the bro.
What time is it?
Same old, same old.
Uh yeah. It's under the couch.
All right, all right.
Oh, Jerry, I'm *surprised* at you!
Well, I- I Ms. Welch I do need to talk to you about a little problem regarding, eh, your performance.
Yeah.
Oh. Delicious to meet you.
I tried bran-- 40%, 50% 100%. The bran isn't working for me.
(gets back on the bus, yelling) Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs. Ladies and Gentlemen you're in for an additional treat. We're going to extend the tour at no extra charge.
Wait, wait, (Exits)
I'm not going back in there!!
[In Newman's ear] You emit a foul and unpleasant odour...
Jerry, you're not in show business. You don't know what these people are like.
What kind of a person are you?
If a guy saved your life you'd be in love with him too.
'felt that the conversation was lagging.
(To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.
Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair.
Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids.
Well, you got wires sticking out every which way. That looks dangerous, you should call the electrician.
Im human.
(shouting to the bathroom door) George, you wanna go for a ride?
Look at you.
Uh, uh, you see thats the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?
Like a history of coffee tables, celebrities and their coffee tables. It's a natural. This is a story that must be told.
(yelling) I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha.
Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff upstairs.
Well, you better get on the horn.
It's cucumbers.
Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister. (he opens the door to leave) Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.
Yeah, a real brouhaha...
Boss!
Oh,
It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry?
Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.
Yeah. (He exits)
No, no, no. It's not the sex, Jerry. (noticing Morty and Helen) Heyy! Seinfelds.
Well, I guess I just assumed.
Yeah..
Get outta here.
Me?
(from inside) OK!
Oh, yeah, yeah. He's after Jerry now.
Hey!
Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk. (drops racquet in the trash) How are you gonna be the executor of my living will?
I drank too much water in the shower.
Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..
Make sure we don't forget where the car's parked.
Jerry, (claps) aaya - what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set.
But she wants the shoes.
All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab.
(sarcastic) Oh, yeah! Yeah!
What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!
(getting up) I'll go get your hat, George.
Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat) Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.
Oh, come on.
..you know, very casually,
Henry Atkins? The postmaster general?
Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me.
It's Halloween (not sure)
Oh, Elaine. Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return.
(To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!
That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.
"Yeah!!!"
SO...you're all in here together. How convenient. I hope you're all proud of yourselves.
And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis.
It's weighing on my conscience.
(Snaps) The Place To Be!
About two hours.
Hey buddy, I'm borrowing all your Tupperware.
We're straightening out!
Definitely.
Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?
Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They ambushed me with a box of 'Grade A's.
"You want me to sleep with you?"
(from inside Jerry's apartment) OK! (door opens)
HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON! (shouting out the window)
You know, maybe in Korean "dog" isn't an insult. Could be like the word "fox" to us. Oh, she's a DOG!
Well, he pushed my buttons, I couldn't help it, Jerry.
(indicating that cars should pass him) Well, go around, you bunch of crazies. You maniacs are gonna get us all killed.
Whoa, psychosexual.
Then why the sniffing? Who walks around (sniff, sniff) sniffing?
For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later. (puts the phone down) Well, somebody's baby-sitting.
Freeze, mother!
Hey, Jerry, guess where I'm calling from!
Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks.
Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings.
Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories.
Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling like this only happens once a year.
(still reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun (Sp?). That was my idea too!
Three quarters of a tank.
(to Gary) How you doing?
Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now. (he rushes back into the theater)
Nothin'.
(pleading) Aww, c'mon, man. Meet me halfway.
Con dios? Well, that's rude.
Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet.
Oh. (Waiter approaches table)
Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother... (thinks for a second) ...Dennis.
Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me.
So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
(pointing to the largest one) Now, what is this?
(Angered) Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! (Leaning over the couch, he addresses George) Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?
Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating, soothing your every aching muscle. The water's gonna get over 120 degrees! (happy)
...Well, actually uh, we're uh, we're not friends Uh, we're uh, we're much more than friends...
Oh that's fatal, you don't want that!
And...cucumbers! (Grabs a large handful and puts them on the pizza.)
Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.
Hey everybody. (to Jerry) Listen, uh, do me a favour, will you? I got a hot date tonight with Connie. Knock on my door, wake me up in twenty minutes, alright?
Hey.
Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids...
South America?
Right.
Phew!
Yeuu.
I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.
Well, they got a stand right out on the platform. Gyros are cooked, and wrapped, and ready to go. (he pulls money from his pocket) Three dollars, no change. You want one?
Well I'm boycotting it.
Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?
(Watching Rusty's pulling of the rickshaw) Giddy up! Good form.
I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.
Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood memorabilia.
Hello boys, (in an Irish accent) top of the morning to ya. What do you say?
Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together.
And we all know how painful that can be. (as he says this, he turns and speaks directly into the non-existent television camera. Jerry looks a bit confused.)
(matter of fact) He had breasts.
Yeah... All right....Ya got it, eh.
(Smiling) You bet we are! Huh, Smuckers? (Smuckers coughs. They turn to leave) I'll see ya.
Uh huh.
Jerry, the whole building is brick.
Why would you think I would invite him?
It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal mechanism. It knows what time it is.
Well I don't want a big flat noodle.
Yeah listen, I need my slicer back.
(chuckles)
Yeah, but then I'd have to... (glances at Elaine) well, you know... into a cup in the middle of the day??
Now look, Rick. Im very close to giving this car, that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement. (Looks out the window) Oooh, Lets see if I can get a smile from these femininas.. (Yells out to them) Hey, Ladies! (Points to the car) Its the Saab 900! What do you think? Can I interest you in a little supplemental restraint?! (They obviously do something to offend him. Kramer reacts with a face) Geez
(Moving back into the room) Oh, yeah?
The guy wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change.
Wait a second. I can get change.
Yeah.
Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think every Puerto Rican in the world is out here.
Well, I sold them to Bania.
I need the yield sign.
A big dinner with dessert. But Ive got till the end of the month.
Oh, boy.
(STILL HOLDING HIS NOSE UP ) This doesn't look familiar to you?
Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already makin' em.
All right, I'll take Karen.
Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive.
Yeah. (beat) And, it was a big one.
Come on up. It's Brody.
I gotta go find this kid. So all you gotta do is lay here, pretend you're asleep in case she gets back, here (grabs the covers and throws em over Mickey) keep the covers over ya.
I'm breaking them in, and they're feeling better.
Hi,
What? Jimmy Sherman?
Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should I pick those up later?
All right now here's the list. (hands Jerry the list)
Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this...
No? That's good.
Yeah, yeah..
Yeah. (leaving)
So Jerry, (smacks hands and rubs palms together) What time we going to the movies?
Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.
Y- B-briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions. (makes a clicking sound)
Is it over four hundred?
Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.
Dng-ga-gng-ga-wt.
What?
George?
I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.
Aah!
Yeah, I've seen them do that.
Ah, no, no, no. I-I couldn't impose.
I mean, we had a deal, Newman. And you were supposed to give my your birthday wish. And now you've wasted it!
Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?
(eating some nachos) Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?
So? I'm innocent! I mean you guys believe that I'm innocent, don't you? Jerry? George?
Mushrooms, you got mushrooms Jerry?
Need some more matches.
Well whats the difference -- Come on (pats him on the back) -- were like Cain and Able.
The Ball, silly.
Wait, wait hold on now, wait, wait *bang* (he slams his hand down on the table, startling Jerry, Elaine and George) *bang* (again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip* *yip* See? I told you.
I didn't say anything.
That's pretty good, huh?
Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave it for me, huh?
Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!
Wha...?
HE..YA. AYA. AYYYYYAAAAA!!!!
(cries out) WELL I SAID I'M SORRY."
Yaaaa.
They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture. (gleeful) These clothes won't last five years without 'em.
I've got plenty of ideas.
Jerry, come on. What'd you say?
What advice would you give young people?
(to Jerry) Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?
(Tired) Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break. (Sets the rickshaw down - taking a rest)
(noise)
Wrong again.
Well you're not exactly zeroing in yourself, lady.
Oh, yeah.
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!
You don't eat Oreos? (acts out eating Oreos) The way you break them open? You're (does a bunch of licking motions) ~ practically having sex with them.
Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office..
Now, you see, that's nice.
Did you enjoy the duck? (Elaine comes back from the bathroom.) Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night.
Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus.
(Concluding) Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh? (Pause) Alright, I'll see you guys. (Leaves, despite "No, don't go!" and other various comments by Jerry and George)
Hey, you got the food?
What is that a Titleist?
Yeah, Im a cop. Im a good cop. Im a damn good cop! (On that line, Kramer points to Ray, and Ray turns back to the wall. Kramer heads for the door.) Todays your lucky day, junior, cause Im gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and youll be sorry. You got me?
The bank can pay 'em.
Yeah, well, let me clue you in on something. There isn't.
I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.
Yeah.
Where are you going?
Hey! You ever been in an accident?
Yeah.
May I..( pointing her food)
YEA!
Well--
Don't step on anything.
Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way "It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one."
She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out.
Here, take one.
enters
That guy.. He was just...
Whoa!!!....That was you?
Aw, all right, I'm looking forward to it.
(laughs as Frank ends up tickling him; gets away) I bought it from Rudy.
I would. I always open medicine cabinets.
Yeah, wait here. Come on, sit down. What's the matter with you?
You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself.
Not as many as there used to be.
You get the tickets?
Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.
Ohh, it's real.
Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.
Oh, uh, Helena, how are you?
Yeah....
God.
[thinks for a while]
(to Joel) Its gonna be hot in a minute.
I'm talking about the thirty percent discount.
That's gunna be trouble.
No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right?
Heeeeey...
Well, not here.
You want these? Knee socks. You dont wear knee socks.
(takes a breath)
Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak hinge.
The factory?
Gonorrhea? You wanna trade?
You got money?
Oh! Well, How do you like that. I got rope. Um, I gotta go.
(high pitched voice) "Well women do it." I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you can just (high pitched voice) sashey your pretty little self around the town square.
Junior Mints. Do you want one?
You wanna keep your job don't you?
Uh, Dwayne.
No way!
All right.
(opens door) Uh--George, uh--uh--it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you..
Uh... great.
Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.
George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.
All right all right. Come on I'll take you over to Newman's
(shrill) What!?
She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.
Alright, so you'll need my frequent flyer number, huh?
(to the exiting Elaine) Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there, (following her out the door) maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses. (shouting after her) Elaine!
Yes.
Its funny.
And you'll get it back.
Awright, I got it.
Yeah.
That's a nice name. Todd Gack. Is that Dutch? (Dingggggg) Oh baby. Here we go. Uh momma.(putting his fresh out of the oven shirt on) Hey George hey.
(momentary confusion) Wha...? Uh... (thoughtful) That's interesting.
(to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
Sure you do.
(grasps Newman's hand) To the Kramennium.
(quickly) Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.
Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out.
(Feet off the ground, his body going everywhere on the couch) Wait, Jerry...Wait a minu...
I don't believe this.
Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax.
No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie.
This food ,it has no taste......nothin' I'm gettin' nothin'...( realizes) It must be the toxic gas from the fumigation......( he leaves paranoid and confused)
You won't regret it. (Jerry mutters some more, Kramer rubs his hands together in anticipation, then starts dancing around with a reluctant Jerry) Jerry's gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy..
"Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together."
Oh. Come on.
I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?
George. I thought you were gonna Change.
Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, permanently.
Whatever you get.
All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?
Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate in my program.
Keep your foot on the gas.
(pointing at Farkus) Very funny.
Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package.
Yeah, and I'm playing a business man accused of murder.
...And you're the manager of the circus.
(talking to himself) Im not happy about this.
What was the question?
Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe.
Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. Hes not going.
You begged me.
Some nut in a clown suit!
Now see the two of you need to work on trust... and then and only then will there be a free exchange of sex and discounts.. Cornerstones of a healthy relationship....and now if you would (taps twice on the door) excuse us. We need to get to bed.
Blood!
Yeah (quietly)
Well, the pleasure's all mine.
Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So, how did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.
Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?
(To Rusty) You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence.
It's your first time. He'll understand.
Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you! Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror, cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!
Okay uh, yeah. I'll have a uh, you have a decaf cappuccino?
There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited.
Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.
What are you looking for?
All right, where you going?
Antonio. In here!
What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?
Heey, good karma for you. (Kramer puts on Jerrys old jacket and stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby.
You're joking.
Here you go.
Mmmmm.
Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm?
Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had an
No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital. I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits.
How can I possibly thank you?
(to Newman) Would you let me say it? Let me talk!
They're ladies' glasses.
(shivering) You know I'm freezin. Im definitely freezin. I can't stop shaking.
What, again? You took one this morning.
There's Salman.
There you go.
You ma, know I've been thinking. I want you to quit that matron job.
So you gonna use it?
... My mother's a matron!
I don't know.
George?
The party, Long Island?
(doing the voice) La la la.
I tell you how much I make.
Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard ... and when you throw it - Pop! Oh look, (FDR is at the cash register, pays and leaves Monks) there's my friend, FDR. I'm gonna nail him in the back of the head. It's gonna be great! (Rushes out of Monks to peg his friend with the snowball)
Sue her?
Oh, lots of 'em.
Listen, this is a million dollars we're talkin' about, Jerry, now this is the big league, the big time, now I need you on my team, Jerry!
They're prisons. Man made prisons. You're doing time. You get up in the morning. She's there. You go to sleep at night. She's there. It's like you gotta ask permission to use the bathroom. Is it all right if I use the bathroom now?
Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight! (Voight waves at Kramer and hurriedly gets in the cab. Kramer runs over to the car.) Hey, listen, can I ask you something? Listen, listen...(Leans in the the open back window of the cab. Defensively, Voight grabs Kramer's arm and bites it. Kramer screams. The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street, stunned.)
Well, what am I gonna do?
rock
"You know.. You really shouldn't brush 24 hours before seeing the dentist."
All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime. (stretches his arm out, as if hes reaching out a good-bye)
(to the ticket man) Uh, yeah, a ticket for Kramer.
Yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, y'know, old-fashioned useless records, y'know, just... lyin' around--
I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning!
You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah.
Ooh, she's a package full of energy!
So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well, let me tell you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway I know. My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them out. My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, and Fontaine, and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down... ...GOOD LUCK... (exits)
(to door) Gah!
All right, I?ll tell you what I?ll do. Cause you look like a nice guy, a thousand dollars for the duce.
Yes.
Oh, my God...
Her bouquet cleaved his hardened...
Oh, alrighty uh...
He thinks you're a phony.
Oh, congratulations.
What's going on?!
We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository.
Yeah-yah.
Yeah.
That's East River.
O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)
Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to get to know one another.
Well, I can guess within an hour.
Hot and spicy.
You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.
Look at you! You've got another gig! Uhh.
Sister Roberta gave it to me.
Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?
Oh, cmon. Shell pay you back. Whats five grand between friends?
Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.
Oh, the one with the crest.
What stuff?
" Hmm! Oh! Yeah. I'll tell you who is an attractive man; Gorge Will."
Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance.
Really.
I don't know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean, without dessicates, those clothes'll be noticeably musty in five years.
Well, you're fired because you don't move your arms when you tap dance, you're like a gorilla out there I've gotta go...
Ah, 's no good.
Was it more than just one?
Well, now what are we gonna do? (to Jerry) See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox.
Yeah.
Hey.
Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific!
Don't you get tired of following rules?
The slicer! Elaine, let's go.
Oh, I'm jiff.
Understand?
I am Kramer.
How're you doin' there, big guy? (Puts his arm around the tobacco store Indian)
I don't know.
Oh yeah.
Yeah, and that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - she's brimmin' with positivity!
Oh, he ran away.
(from the other side of the door) Police! Open up!
Shall we go?
Hey, do me a favor... Some guy comes in looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am.
What point?
Yeah. It feels like we're stealing it.
All right, how 'bout Ithaca vs. Boston?
"Well...He's singing at a benefit and I'm gonna be sitting at his table."
Come on. Where'd you go?
Why? What's one thing got to do with another?
I think we are looking half a millimeter.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Ya.
So, then you asked yourselves, "Isn't there something more to life?"
(looking at picture) Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. BIG computers.
Yeah. Could you hold on for a second? I've got something on the stove.
But I want to--
Hello, twelve dollars.
Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.
I don't think I can talk to you any more. I feel inferior.
You ever seen Michael Jordan?
He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it.
"No No I've been living alone a long time now."
H-Hey. She's hungry Jerry.
It's a business.
yeah I sang 99 bottles of beer on the wall
Yeah. I know that. Uh, uh.
What took you so long? Hey, Ping!
I want restitution.
Yeah well we go way back.
(enters apartment, holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! (inserts tape into VCR, sets up TV)
Bugger!
Well, you can get 'em back.
No no, he's never met her. She's in California.
Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.
No, an eighteen-wheeler's no good. Too much overhead. You got permits, weigh-stations, tolls... Look, you're way outta your league.
Jeannie left?
Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out.
"I'm a guest of honor."
Yeah, Frank Costanza, he's getting me a room at his lodge. So Jerry, you know I'm really counting on you to come to this.
Sure you can. (to Jerry) Such a sweet kid.
Where do you turn it on?
Ooo, What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?
Come on, I'll rub some on yours.
No, that's no good. I'm leaving.
Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.
They're from the lost and found at the Alex.
Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it.
No, I really think you're wrong. We just went to the fireworks the other day.
(pointing) You can go over here.
Exactly
Yeah, yeah. Of course. I took it.
(Excited) Done!
Youre not going?
Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.
Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight?
What, are you locking the door now?
Hey, listen, can I borrow your suitcases?
Come on, Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit?
(shouting back) Oh, unforgettable.
It was easy the last time.
Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?
Oh, yeah.
The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness.
She does fine work.
(beckoning to George) Come on, I want you to come in here.
No, no. A bra is for ladies.
Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out.
And Buck Showalter's?
No, I'm not going to let this happen.
Yeah,
Well, obviously there was a miscommunication.
And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.
Ya, Mickey. He hooked me up. We're stand-ins for the actors on 'All My Children.' Mickey, he's a stand-in for an eight year old kid and I stand in for the kids father.
alright, who's gonna tell her
Tupperware.
She's really gotten to you, hasn't she?
(loungingly talking on phone) It's a par five. So you know I step up to the tee and I hit a beautiful drive right down the middle of the fairway. I mean you know my hook, right?
Newman?
All right I'll be back in a second. You guys coming to my party? (exits)
Hey, stay away from the chicken. Bad, bad chicken, mess you up.
(stops) W--Reggie Miller.
Why not?
(still trying to sit down, says under his breath) I'm trying. {hard to make out}
Well, what about your deal, huh?
Exclamation point.
Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back.
From now on, I'll be calling the shots around here...
(impatient sigh) You don't have a problem.
Right.... Don't mention my name
I told you, I threw it out.
[Yeah] (through the door)
My contention?
Hang on.
Apparently.
(reaching in pocket) Hey, would you like a cigar? Y'know, they're Cubans.
All right, so we let the girls decide.
Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?
Oh yeah!
I know what this is about Father. I didnt do anything. I just spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. Its just that, that I have this power.
Well, that was alright, huh?
Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit.
Huh, Okay.
Hey, you wanna come down the fire station with me?
Yeah.
Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks.
Well, I ah, gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?
Well, I'm gonna type it up.
So you'll buy them?
(looks inside the car and gasps) Ohhh Sweet Maria. Hey! lets go.
I'm here to talk about the ocean.
No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry.
I don't believe this, I'm being typecast.
Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,
(reading a tombstone) 'Man's best friend'. Jerry, I want something like that on my tombstone.
Oh, that's right.
Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.
Well, I overbought!
Did you bring the video camera?
You can't fire me, I'm Santa Claus.
What puddle?
Where?
Huh? Who are you?
(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you. (Pulling the rickshaw with Newman) Let's get this baby home.
No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.
what is this?
Yeah.
Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself.
Alright, so you're gonna look after it?
Hello boys.
Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again.
I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. The millennium. I told you about that.
My friend he's a conductor.
Ahh....
maana I'm doing nada
Did you hear about Newman?
(Reassuring) Hey, this look's better than anything you own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing the (imitates a pirate) pirate look!
You stubborn, stupid, silly man!
What about "Sonia Live"? Now you're not cancelling "Sonia Live"?
Well, that's how cats do it.
..The busboy's coming! The busboy's coming!
Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage disposal?
A kidney stone.
I'll go.
Dont you know what that does to suede?
Got a minute?
No, you told me not to!
All right lets take a look to see what we got ( examines George's head) Wait a second.. I think I see something here George. Lets go to the videotape.
Real Boss!
Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.
No, no.
Rock, paper, scissors match.
Drugs? You think he's on drugs?
(going after Toby) Toby! Toby!
Hey
I guess I screwed up!
Mmm, these are good, huh?
But why?
No time!
Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.
(shivering) I don't know.
"Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for." (Pleased by the note, Kramer stumbles into his car).
Hey, I dont care. Im just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock, now!
Hey, I'm going to get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy. You see.
Oh, Ive been in the slash many times. This is nothing. Youll get used to it. Just, (Makes a popping sound) put it out of your mind.
(to Judge) I was very upset that day.
Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside!
Well I don't know . I was in the bathroom , the kitchen...
Woah! Wait!
Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh! I know what I think. I think you're gaga over this dame. She's twisted you around her little finger, and now, you're willing to sell me, and Elaine, and whoever else you have to, right down the river.
She doesn't have a boyfriend. She made it up.
Yeah, Yeah...Why, is it too cold out?
