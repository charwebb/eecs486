Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.
(running to the window) What?! Not my car!! Hey!! They're towing my car!!
Well, (rubs hands) I gotta meet Newman at the pet store. Helping him pick out a turtle.
Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didnt like it.
Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think. If he could go...
All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?
You don't pay five cents, you get five cents back. Here, read the label here. (reads from bottle) Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York. Refund, (brings bottle up close to Newman's eyes) vrrup, five cents.
Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent.
I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. It's like a ski lodge.
Wait, wait hold on now, wait, wait *bang* (he slams his hand down on the table, startling Jerry, Elaine and George) *bang* (again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip* *yip* See? I told you.
Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldn't crunch the numbers. It drove me crazy.
You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.
I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your place.
Ooo, yeah.. (indicating his face, embarrassed) (Heh, right.) You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--
I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is?
Sure you can. (to Jerry) Such a sweet kid.
I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby.
(still overly excited) Who wants to have some fun!
Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy.
What does it look like I'm doing? What?
Federal Express? Of course. That's the oldest trick in the book. You know it might not be a burglar it could be a murderer.
He spit on us.... and I screamed out, "I'm hit!"
Oh yeah. It's a warm and wonderful feeling, Jerry. So what are you doing later?
Well, that didnt work. Hey, how about thisketchup and mustard in the same bottle?
Yeah, I know! I was watchin' the game.
No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware.
Ya, Mickey. He hooked me up. We're stand-ins for the actors on 'All My Children.' Mickey, he's a stand-in for an eight year old kid and I stand in for the kids father.
(aggressive) Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?!
Well, I'm not leaving the premises without tote bags. I was promised tote bags and tote bags I shall have.
Well, I don't know what to do man!
I told you I sold them to Bania.
Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair.
(high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.
Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.
(handing out anti-mail pamphlets) Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it on. Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend.
I'm sorry Newman, you were holding us back.
It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!
I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.
No, this is vintage. They don't make this stuff anymore.
I didn't know you made that kinda money. (subdued) Jeez.
Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!
Alright we gotta get back to the show. What are you guys doing?
All right, you can have it. (Kramer tosses the statue to George.)
Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here.
Look, it's personalized. (Holds it up, reading) "The Costanzas"
Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the Village, then you're gonna see a magic show.
No, thank you. So what are you doing?
Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?
Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now. (he rushes back into the theater)
Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...(gestures to Elaine to sign the form.)
I tried bran-- 40%, 50% 100%. The bran isn't working for me.
Ha ha, the Ukraine. Do you know what the Ukraine is? It's a sitting duck. A road apple, Newman. The Ukraine is weak. It's feeble. I think it's time to put the hurt on the Ukraine.
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. (to Jerry) I've always had a thing for Noreen.
Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?
So, how long you been drivin' this thing?
CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach.
Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair.
Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive. Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it. 8173.
Let's go.... OK. (he snaps the towel at Naomi's backside) GOTCHA.
Yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico...you know, when you two went down there?
(Enters with a box) Alright, that's it. Anything else?
Ah, you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room, better ride? Well, I'm bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen.
Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do.
NO, he's not.. Just a fat little mental patient.
Good, good. Lets uh keep it that way.
Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you! Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror, cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!
Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak.
Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture.
Look, I know what's going on. The oink, oink.
Yeah, well I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight lasted two seconds.
(deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
(voice; yelling) Toby! (Shot of a shocked Kramer is shown) Oh, Oh!
As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a freeloader.
Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other at our word, all is lost.
Oh, the face-painting auto mechanic. So she's dating him again, huh?
(shouting) Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees!
My Cubans! (runs off to the burning cabin)
(continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.
And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for fifteen hundred dollars!
Hey, spice. (gives Elaine a piece of meat.) Welcome to flavor country.
Just a little place I like to call, "Youll see".
So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing.
Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?
Oh. This is all burned up. Look at this.
It's all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerry's)
Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls with such gusto.
(Feet off the ground, his body going everywhere on the couch) Wait, Jerry...Wait a minu...
Hey. That's a big oven. Huh. Listen. I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!
It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what?
Alright, alright. Look, Jerry, we gotta get down to PBS, PDQ.
Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy. (he half-coughs, half-retches) I gotta get, some air.
Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice?
No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without Dijon.
Hey buddy. I am waiting for my shirt.
(Answering phone) Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.
Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna show you, and you'll never be the same.
No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?
These are Cubans. (IN FAKE SPANISH) Maria, poquendo los scientos de estes con gleam.
Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my car-pool lane.
Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know.
(Obviously watching the nudist across the street) Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there.. (Jerry looks back at Kramer in envy) It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed.. that's good, that's good.. yes, yes, yes..
All right, [claps hands] I'm gonna go get some soup.
Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have they changed your shower head?
Okay uh, yeah. I'll have a uh, you have a decaf cappuccino?
(Making his way toward the door) What? They just gotta be worked in a little bit, that's all. (Pulling the door shut behind him) Alright, see you later.
Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years.
Yeah. You know, I think Elaine is a wonderful woman. You two are gonna make a wonderful couple.
Listen, I need you to do me a favor.
Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something for me.
You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces. I mean, you gotta look quick, but they're there.
Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little (makes a series of noises) out there.
Well, all over the place. Yeah, I'm a seat filler. They don't like to see empty seats on TV so when somebody gets up I just park my kaboos on their spot until they get back.
Oo, y- what are you doing with her? (Jerry ignores him and exits)
Well no, I don't have them on me.
You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.
no problem, ... no problem. [Hangs up] ... How did YOU know who that was?
(to the exiting Elaine) Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there, (following her out the door) maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses. (shouting after her) Elaine!
(on the phone) what about the driver? we could get an accident
Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together.
The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights.
Clark Bar. (Kramer starts tearing the candy wrapper open with his teeth.)
No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh...
Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months.
You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family.
Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say.
Yeah, and that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - she's brimmin' with positivity!
I here you make a pretty mean calzone.
..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in
Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that.
You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop  Regis and Kathy Lee.
Im not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it.
I'll let her down easy. All right. (he gets up and walks to Olive) Well, hi Olive. (she reaches for Kramer's back) No, no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you.
Jerry, my house is a pigsty, come on.
Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah.
Elaine. you don't know the first thing about first base.
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. (pulls out his pocket-watch (it has a chain, too)) I am springin' ahead riiight now.
All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour...
Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go check it out.
(getting a bottle of water out of the fridge) Yeah, well, Elaine's new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's a Farbman.
Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. You hear me?
D-d-d-d. I gotta switch shaving creams. I'm getting no protection.
Yeah, I'll talk to Jerry. Yeah, [Hangs up] . . . you know that was Michael and Carol. She's wondering when we're going to come over and see the baby.
All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way (grabs framed card)
Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.
From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you don't know me.
I, uh, need to speak to you about some lady problems.
The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno.
Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?
Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...
whoa whoa ginga, you were supposed to tie the knot
Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.
Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.
Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh! I know what I think. I think you're gaga over this dame. She's twisted you around her little finger, and now, you're willing to sell me, and Elaine, and whoever else you have to, right down the river.
Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.
Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. (Poppie enters.)
All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there.
Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.
You know what my feelings are about this. I don't even pay taxes.
Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.
Man! I never thought you were capable of this!
No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. (Pulls up his sleeve and shows George his arm.) Look.
Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the air.
Hes got all of my attachments, you know.
See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?
Hey, wheres your new jacket? (Jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom. Its ruined.) What? (Kramer enters the bathroom, and sees the garment.) Ohhh. What did you do to it?
If only I could say things like that around her.
Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna.
Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah, they got their own case at the end of the aisle.
Oh, cmon. Shell pay you back. Whats five grand between friends?
Oh, Queensboro Plaza. (reties his shoelaces) This stop is famous for its gyros, you want one?
yeah I sang 99 bottles of beer on the wall
I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?
Here. I write it down. (he writes) "One cupcake." And then I put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and drops it into the bowl) There. Very simple.
Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?
Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy.
(getting up) I'll go get your hat, George.
Now look, we're going to stop at the shoe maker right now. You gotta get some lifts for your shoes.
I've been drinking Caf Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back.
(triumph) Yesss! Alright, so it's you, it's me, and it's Jerry, huh. (claps hands) Yeah, now things are starting to snowball, huh. I'll tell Newman I don't need him. So, I'll uh, see you two in the twenty-first century.
What? What this? I'll be out of here in couple of hours. Hey, guess who I met today? Rick Savage, oh nice kid, really good kid. You know, we're talking about doing a project together.
Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia!
You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?
Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there! (Pauses) All right, next story..
I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
(dismayed) So what am I in this for? You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. (is tearing up)
I got down in my knees and went, "Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, I love you!"
Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
(stops again) Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hotdog at Reggie Miller. "Involved." An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.
(Smiling) You bet we are! Huh, Smuckers? (Smuckers coughs. They turn to leave) I'll see ya.
Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?
What about "Sonia Live"? Now you're not cancelling "Sonia Live"?
Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.
Okay, look, uh, when you're in Florida, can my cigar guy drop off some Cubans for me at your parents' house?
Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?
Well, I gotta have a central nervous system.
(on phone) A turkey sandwich. A side of slaw,  you want whit e meat or dark?
Hey, I look like Joe Friday in Dragnet.
A big dinner with dessert. But Ive got till the end of the month.
You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away.
Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.
No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.
Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha -- Yeah. He's a wonderful man.
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' CRAZY in these things! (leaves)
Awright I'm gonna get George to pick me up.
You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.
No I think he's got you beat buddy.
Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!
What are you doing this for? Look at you..
Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.
well it's a dog leg left, so I play the hook right? .. hold on there's another call.
If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?
Eight bucks! I think I got ripped off! (Leaves, yelling out "Newman!")
Oh man, if I don't get that black paint off the City's gonna go ape. I don't wanna lose my baby!
Alright, alright, fine. You take the monkey's side, alright, go ahead.
(whistles). He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.
Y'know you've given this comedy thing your best shot. Yeah, you had some good observations, but it's over. Now, this Bloomingdale thing, that could be the next wave.
I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I got kugel working at Mrs. Zamfino's, this is kreplach. Here, try some of this.
Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area.
Uh, uh, you see thats the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?
"Yeaheum ... You're not doing too bad yourself"
Yes, she's the costume designer and he's the wig master for the show.
AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. (George enters.) Hey!
(Tired) Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break. (Sets the rickshaw down - taking a rest)
Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou.
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!
Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out.
Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every three hours. Now, that works out to two and a half extra days, that I'm awake per week, every week. Which means, if I live to be eighty, I will have lived the equivalent of a hundred and five years.
I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way out there!
So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac.
Alright, that's enough out of you, there's still three more games left in this series, my friend, and it's far from being over. Very far from being over. (Notices a car coming right towards Puddy, who's crossing the street) Watch out!
Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...(Puts a slice of meat under the door.)
(screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT,
Ooh. Well, this is uh, risky business, huh? I'm all a-twitter.
I drank too much water in the shower.
What? Two animal acts on the same show? (turns to Jerry) What is this, amateur hour? Look, George, I'm sorry, maybe another time, all right? (drums table and exits)
"Well, because we hit it off and he was very impressed with what I do."
Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!
The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride.
Don't sweat it buddy...I used to have fleas.
I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky yourself, buddy.
Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a (Snaps his fingers in rhythm with his words) lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog (Stops snapping) - all on the same day.
Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself.
Put that on the top of your list.
Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that guy can't even go to the bathroom in South America!
(to a fleeing Audrey) Where are you going?
Jerry, we got 'im. I'm riding his tail. There's no escape. He's running scared, buddy.
Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright.
Ya well, theres no bet if Im not doing it.
No. No. No. Its for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact.
Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you see George, the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah!
Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.
So whats going on between you and Gina?
It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Git gt gt.
Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy who's kid's in the hospital .
I got it! This time, I got it!
Now listen Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much. But sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.
(pleased) Ah, see. (rubs his hands together) I got the whole night ahead of me. (looks at Jerry) Boy, that's a nice jacket, huh?
All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.
It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!
Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other hand he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?
I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh...
Well, I'm not saying that! You know, things are going pretty well for me here. I met a girl...
Let's turn the radio on. Maybe there's a news report about it.
I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm never gonna talk again.
Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?
(reads) Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo?
Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? None other than Miss Chita Rivera.
Yeah, well, I could do it. I dont wanna do it.
Hey. Well, I just spoke to your girlfriend.
The way I figure it I've already been there and I plan on rounding second tonight at around eleven o'clock.
Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that
Hey see He said hed loan you the money.
Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement.
Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass frames?
I didn't kill anyone, I swear! I swear to God!
Alright. I'm ready. (To George) You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?
Oh. All right. You don't know what your missing. I'm loving this Jerry. I am never putting on another piece of clothing unless it's straight out of the dryer.
(Shrugging it off) Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line.. (Looks at Jerry, then leans in so Elaine can't hear) Plus, the botched my vasectimy.
(interrupting) Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo.
Jerry, I dont think this thing is hooked up right.
You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed birthday card that was inside.
Yeah, and I'll tell ya something else. Stan's advice has transformed my game. He's never wrong. Oh, he thinks eventually I'll have a shot at making it big on the senior tour. (sucks in air through tight lips) Oh, that's my dream, Jerry.
Jerry these are load bearing walls, they're not gonna come down!
I didn't have any quarters for the dryer. Anyway this is better. And it's more convenient.
Well my buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, he--uh--visits the guy across the hall from me like every ten minutes.
Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing.
Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. The shave is close and clean, and the natural emolients keep my skin silky-smooth. Now feel my face.
He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me.
Dont you know what that does to suede?
Yeah, okay, So I'll see you tomorrow uh?
Well, I had some hard candy in there.
But you got a whole pile here. 1987?
Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) Here.
(looking after fleeing car) Newman! The white whale!
Oh? What's she in for? (putting groceries in the fridge)
Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks.
...Well, actually uh, we're uh, we're not friends Uh, we're uh, we're much more than friends...
(simultaneous) Wait a minute, on the cover I'm...
(Up to something) Well, its a test drive, right? I never drive around here. If Im gonna recommend this car, I need to see that itll handle my daily routine.
Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?
These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.
No, an eighteen-wheeler's no good. Too much overhead. You got permits, weigh-stations, tolls... Look, you're way outta your league.
