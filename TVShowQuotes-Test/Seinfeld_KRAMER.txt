(a little anxious) You know, after I have sex with Emily, uh, I don't want her in the bed any more.
Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face?
Huh, oh hey, look at this. (he pulls a little tube out of the bag) It's the super hydrating, triple-action moisturizer, hmm.
But that's the idea, you make your own pie.
That looked like milk to me! Jerry my Rods and Cones are all screwed up! Alright, that's it.  I gotta move in with you Jerry.
Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fianc, Peter Von Nostrand.
(sighs) All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him.
Hey, wheres your new jacket? (Jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom. Its ruined.) What? (Kramer enters the bathroom, and sees the garment.) Ohhh. What did you do to it?
Why did you get rid of that sausage?
Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.
Cool it lady ( they struggle and we here a siren)
(opens door) Uh--George, uh--uh--it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you..
I *love* the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette!
Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee.
She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus?
Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!
The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on..
Hey, you got to get this thing fixed.
I'm going home to spatula. (picks up the check and walks to the cashier)
Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?
Yeah, like Diane Fosse. You know she's the only person that's ever been accepted into gorilla society. And you know, once those gorillas accept you, you got it made in the shade.
Oh, Vincent is an art-house goon. I stick to the Gene rack.
C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago.
Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.
Well it's a story about love, deception, greed, lust and...unbridled enthusiasm.
Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works over at the police station. He's a composite artist.
These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.
Alright look I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?
Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. (points to plate) Proctology.
It's a golf club! It's no gun. He threw a golf club at me!
Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?
Well, there's only one way to settle this. (Starts pointing back and forth between Newman and him with each word of the rhyme) One spot, two spot, zig, zag, tear, pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scare 'em, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe..
What me? Fabulous, just fabulous. I've got a lot of auditions, a lot of call backs and I've got a lot of interest for my movie treatment. I'm in development, I'm in developed vehicles. And there's a lot of energy here, man. You know, the vibe, it's powerful. I'm just swept up at it. Yeah, I'm a player.
Pay dirt! (holding up the hand full of gloves. He looks behind himself as the door closes)
I'm calling the shots around here so there won't be anymore ACCIDENTS!
Well I thought it was so your parents wouldn't walk in while you're with a girl.
You know, for phone numbers, addresses, keep appointments, everything.
I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your place.
It's about this woman, in a coma. Well, I couldn't finish watching it, so I want you to read this.
I'm not going to take the bus that's why I got a car!
Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.
Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.
Alright we gotta get back to the show. What are you guys doing?
Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate other women, and they hate you.
Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't have the problems we have in the world today. Well, you don't rob somebody, if you know their name!
Hey, do me a favor... Some guy comes in looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am.
Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all *hopped* up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuffin' cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!
Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.
Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.
Our neighbor that you... turned against. (Jerry reacts) Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway.
Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.
yeah I sang 99 bottles of beer on the wall
Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These guys don't have it.
Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?
I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.  I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.
(All right.) (to Jerry) Ah? Oh, by the way you owe Mike a hundred dollars.
(nodding) I'll get the shovel. (walks towards his apartment, as Jerry grimaces at the prospect)
My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit!
Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines? (makes noise - bum, bum, bum, bum, bump)
(pouring cereal) Oh yeah. Most important meal of the day.
(moody) Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends.
Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?
Four hours in this chop and I'm a full inch taller. . . . Giddyup.
I, uh, need to speak to you about some lady problems.
Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status.
(inspecting Jerry's van) So, how come you're selling it?
Oh, yeah, thanks. (gets ball) Yeah, it's got the magic grip. How d'you think I bowled that two-twenty today, huh? (sees Indian) Yo! Where did this come from?
Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!
Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you, you're a word man. Alright, let's go deeper. Uh, what kind of man are you? Well, you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations, but what tempts you?
Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.
They want to know why they never see you.
What're you talking about?! We had a deal!
Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?
Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know, (makes a noise) they block it! So, I lunged for the bathroom. (demonstrates) I grab the knob - Occupado! Then they back me up agains the cartoon map of Italy, and all of the sudden, they just stop.
Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package.
Well, I, uh, I borrowed it last night and it got a little dirty.
Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated, hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws. (One of the homeless men starts to wander off, walking away) Now, I don't caer where you're from, or how you got here, or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit.
No. (To George) But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?
See, the other thing is, if you dont like anything, he takes it right back.
Last week. When I, you know, gave you the phone. Hes really into my pizza place idea!
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!
Hey, you wanna come down the fire station with me?
Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience.
Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?
When we went to dinner the other night.
(pointing to the newspaper ad) Well, I don't really have any money. But it says right here, 'interesting trades considered'.
(pulling out an undershirt) And I'm glad I did. Here.
Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something.
(looking at picture) Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. BIG computers.
I don't know! (building to a shout) But I woke up in the Hudson river in a SACK!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling the cops.
And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees.
I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind.
Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?
Yeah, yeah. I got investors all lined up.
All right lets take a look to see what we got ( examines George's head) Wait a second.. I think I see something here George. Lets go to the videotape.
(bangs arm of couch in frustration) You peeked!
(on the phone in Jerry's apartment) So when are you gonna be able to go out?
Oh, the stub, yeah. I left it in my, my pants
What are you gonna do with the leather one?
(snaps his fingers) That's perfect. (to the Japanese) Hey, how would you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?
(re the chips) Hmm, Macchu Picchu. Are these free?
Oh well, he's more than O.K., he won!
Look at you! You've got another gig! Uhh.
Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.
So maybe I'll go down there and watch, uh? She'll be there, ,maybe.
I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen.
Well, I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt.
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.
(grabs the ticket back and holds it up to the light) It must have been the botanical extracts.
Yeah, yeah. (Pulls a bottle out of his pocket) I got some pilss. They taste terrible.
This food ,it has no taste......nothin' I'm gettin' nothin'...( realizes) It must be the toxic gas from the fumigation......( he leaves paranoid and confused)
Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me, big mouth.
(Trying to avoid the issue) Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're going. (To his three friends) Vamanos, muchachos!
Hey, I dont care. Im just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock, now!
Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said 'Sonny boy, take a good look at him, that's gonna be you some day.'
Cars can go on empty, but not us humans, huh, fella? Ill get us a couple of Twix bars.
Yeah (points towards the doctor's office), he's the Assman! Jerry, *he's* the Assman!
Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in.
Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real nice and tight. And he's... (Imitates scooping up ice cream. Elaine and Jerry laugh)
Good, good. Lets uh keep it that way.
Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! (Hugs George, and jumps up and down) Hee, hee, hee!
You put my life's stories in his autobiography?
Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! (Jerry puts on his coat) This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it.
Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..
You go to the airlines, you tell them you got a death in the family? They give you 50% off the fare.
Well its a Bordeaux. Robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais -- which is richer and fruitier. Ahh, here's one. Twelve dollars.
Hey. (He's carrying a suit cover. He hangs it on Jerry's coat hooks)
Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing.
Ah, (smacks hands) there you are. My date stood me up. Listen, will you guys go to the operation with me?
Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut.
Oh the red. Yeah, Its the chicken roaster sign. You know, its right across from my window.
So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing it out for me.
Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple a chance to loosen up.
So, there were a lot of people there, huh?
Ah, well I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live.
Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died.
You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.
(laughing) I'm all ticklish. (a moth flies out of his shirt; they all look at it)
Oh. I talked to Arthur Jobanian. Yeah, the Drake's wedding? That's off.
Woah, wait, wait, wait. If you make a birthday wish out loud, it doesn't come true.
Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market.
Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year. (signing as he speaks) So I haven't been able to do it in a while.
Well, buddy, (claps) he's taking the case! Jackie Chiles is right on it! Right on it, he's all over it!
Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little (makes a series of noises) out there.
Ok, yeah. All right look, I'll be out of here by noon. Maybe we'll have lunch together, huh?
Listen, we went in on a CD together.
I know it's not what the ladies like. But without some solid sack time, I'm a zombie.
Alright, you know what this is gonna do? He's gonna be upset because you didn't call him and we're not gonna get those tickets for Friday night.
Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.
I dont know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I havent been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. Im clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right?
(looking around) Look at this building. What is this?
That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.
..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts the door behind him)
Leapin' Larry's? Hey, that's uptown. You gotta take Amsterdam.
Huh, yeah. (looks round) Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, d'you have any paint thinner? I need like uh, forty gallons.
The way I figure it I've already been there and I plan on rounding second tonight at around eleven o'clock.
I wish you never mentioned it to ME. [exits]
It's a myth. Besides, it makes sex more pleasurable.
Hm, That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys, growing up.
I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows that 'damn' expression behind George)
Wooo, you know what you just did? You let a burglar in the building.
Whew, chicks man. Too many chicks know my number.
Man, Ughhhh, wwwheh. I just came from Roy's. I threw up from the gas.
Well, I gotta have a central nervous system.
So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?
(rushed) Yea, Hey. (Kramer enters.) Um, you wanted to see me Father?
Oh, well. I, uh, thought we made a deal for Quinn's t-shirt.
Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!
(Looks at the bags on the floor) Evidently.
"Yeah! They isolate the muscles. The muscle has to grow....or die."
Hey, I'm going to be right back. I'm going to get a match.
Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories.
Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance.
Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat!
So, what's your game? What do you like to play?
(quickly) Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.
Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman.
(pointing to the largest one) Now, what is this?
Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider.
(having lunch with Jerry and his parents) Oh, well... I handed out all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think we've got this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman, he won't be leavin' any tips where he is.
Ahh, no, no, no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself of things. It's fun. Very monastic.
Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in the washing machine.
Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come with it. It's like Endora's box.
(Trying to open a back of chips) Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now!
Uh, see here, I.. (Pulls out a paper ring from his pocket) I saved one of the cigar rings..
But they do and they are the ones writing it off.
There's nothing in there that I haven't seen before.
[In Newman's ear] Alright, well be back, jack.
Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom, ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba.
That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.
Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah.
Well, what're you gonna do with all that money?
All right, all right, I'm gonna help you.
You sure you dont want me to take my clothes off? (beat) Ill do it!
Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here!
Yes, I'm free. (singing) 'cause the murderer struck again!
Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we don't play at all.
Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. (to Jerry) I've always had a thing for Noreen.
Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage disposal?
It's all fresh. Fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. I buy it, I omniga nominga, I eat it.
You talk about your day. How was your day today? Did you have a good day today or a bad day today? Well, what kind of day was it? Well, I don't know. How about you? How was your day?
Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.
We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository.
I didn't know you made that kinda money. (subdued) Jeez.
Common Jerry, this guy is crazy. Get out.
Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal dissension about the name.
Ya, Mickey. He hooked me up. We're stand-ins for the actors on 'All My Children.' Mickey, he's a stand-in for an eight year old kid and I stand in for the kids father.
He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags.
No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have introduced him.
There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?
Yeah, thats Jerry, you dont have to worry about him. Why dont you go across the hall and get started on that mail.
No, you'll never get a better deal than that.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?
Jerry? I have an announcement. Your grandmother is on the line.
(To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!
(reading from the Penthouse Forum) "I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true" (exits to street) " A few weeks ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive she thought our new neighbor Linda was"
How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot of other stuff. Oh, yyyeeah.
Al-righty (sits down) Have you got yourself a cold?
Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other hand he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?
Oh come on Jerry, its opening night, black tie, Pagliacci! The great clown, the great sad tragic clown, like you.
Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?
The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride.
A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.
All right. Now you listen, and you listen good. I know who you are. You're the scofflaw.
Yeah, but before I met up with her, I stopped to look at the monkeys, when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel. I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I *whap* let him have it.
Mine was better than that! Come on look. (starts to laugh again, Jerry too)
Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here.
Yeah! Bunsen burner. (runs his fingers through the flame) oo ya ya.
Roger's can't sell chicken around here, we got chicken places on every block.
Yeah, and I'm playing a business man accused of murder.
Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.
I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long, and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this look. (faking to slurp spaghetti) Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down... (waitress comes to take the order) Bran lakes...100%. I got a big problem.
The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces together) Yeah.
I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff...
Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!
Hey! Elaine. Go Like this. (imitating a mannequin posture)
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!
HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON! (shouting out the window)
As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her.
Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?
Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant.
Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children?
(pulling out his timepiece) Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.
Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always...
Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--
(still trying to sit down, says under his breath) I'm trying. {hard to make out}
(loudly) Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.
Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79.
(interrupting Bania) That don't make you look high-waisted.
Well my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself miles and miles of open lanes.
The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.
Jerry, I think Im on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall?
I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.
It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal mechanism. It knows what time it is.
No, no, n--Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stick with it. No, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. (he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up) My boys need a house!
Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!
(to tourists) Hey, are you folks from Japan.
(pronouncing it "kar-ah-tay") Karate, Jerry. Karate. The lifetime pursuit of balance and harmony.
(from his apartment) Hey, Jerry! Come here a sec!
No, no. Not me. I just happen to know someone who specializes in exactely these kinds of sticky situations.
Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?
Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.
Well no, I don't have them on me.
Wait, wait, wait, now... He's throwin them out??
it's in my book - "Astonishing Tales of the Sea" 51 people died.
Yeah. Hey I want you to hear something.
Remember that guy who took my jacket. The one I found at my mother's house.
All right, Ill get ya a Mounds bar. Keep the engine running.
Hey, Are you going to the hospital now?
No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.
Oh ah, yeah, I'm here for the audition.
Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!
No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled.
Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I want.
Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna show you, and you'll never be the same.
"well of course I noticed it too with those cannibal breasts and pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock out." (turns the page)
...Well, actually uh, we're uh, we're not friends Uh, we're uh, we're much more than friends...
Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, that was a Shemp, right?
Oh yeah, it's working out. And I got a date with that waitress who works at Reggies.
I saw a couple of other guys out there.
Well, its your phone. He wanted to talk to you.
In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!
I just found a guy whos willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.
You follow your katra, and you can do anything. (leads her to the door) Now get out of here.
Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls.
Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but they all stink!
All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter section. (Jerry enters) Hey.
(noticing suds all over his clothes and body) Wha...? Oh, man! Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me what I'm doing wrong.
Come on! Look, I'll give you my next birthday wish, huh?
I parked in front of that restaurant . As soon as this race is over I got to go to the airport.
Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive. (Jerry throws out the spatula)
Santa speaks the language of all children. A notchie watchie dotchie do.
Oh, uh, is this uh, Bette Midler's understudy?
Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out.
The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey) Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards.
Well, I need you to help me move my refrigerator.
Ah, well, just tell her that it's Kramer.
(indicating that cars should pass him) Well, go around, you bunch of crazies. You maniacs are gonna get us all killed.
Well, I'm not leaving the premises without tote bags. I was promised tote bags and tote bags I shall have.
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!
Yeah. (Lies on the couch and cracks the back of his head against the armrest.) Hey, what's with your ceiling? (Mom and Pop look up.)
Yea we worked it out all over dinner last night.
(trying to act like the guy playing the Father) I'm not really going away, I told you I'd be back every other weekend.
You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.
(From a phone booth right outside the store) Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.
Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks.
I said " Jump." Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I said " Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop bothering me." At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something.
You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so thrilled.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I was a little off last week, huh Jerry -- Yeah but the doctor says it was just a slight concussion
Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down, and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out.
(still reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun (Sp?). That was my idea too!
Ha ha ha ha. Yeah, well, Ill tell you, she's a full-figured gal.
(to Judge) I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.
Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never be like you!
Look I'm tellin-- (he does a double take and looks at George) I'm telling ya, that was Joe DiMaggio.
Well then we saw this woman, and she was wearing a bra with no top.
Ah, that makes sense, that's a good call, Stan. Alright, we'll see you guys later, huh?
(taking notes on showering men at the YMCA) Now see, that's smart. Constant motion. Wow.
Hey. Right, I talked to this lawyer guy, Shellbach. Now, he's gonna set me up, but you gotta come with me and be the executor.
Well how should I have "broached the subject"
...so I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. I wanted to be a policeman.
And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.
(agitated) I mean, it's killing me! Newman's got the jump on the invites, and will crush me if I try to go it alone!
Oh, man...(looks to the glove compartment for a manual.) "If the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner". Never, I can't do that.
Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them to do.
(Leaving) George, you listen to me. I owe ya one.
Cosmo, go. No, no, na, na. (he pushes the end button and pushes the antenna down) Boy this new telephone number's driving me crazy -- wrong numbers, every five minutes.
You know Frank, you could take a break.
