Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.
Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.
That might be a problem. (TO ELAINE) Where's your little bag of...
Here, get a newspaper. (Kramer hands George a Newspaper)
Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldn't crunch the numbers. It drove me crazy.
Well that's what we want, the Commando 450.
Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore.
Hes got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?
Yeah, and that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - she's brimmin' with positivity!
Here we go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!
(bangs arm of couch in frustration) You peeked!
(getting up to leave) Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York.
My mother told me that he got arrested for mail fraud
Well, its all taken care of. Everythings cool.
well it's a dog leg left, so I play the hook right? .. hold on there's another call.
All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement. (shuts door)
See, that stinks. You cant eat that. You should take that back.
Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!
Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..
Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!
Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs.
Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing.
No, Im tellin you, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie.
Y- B-briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions. (makes a clicking sound)
Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. (Pointing a finger at Jerry)
In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in men's fashion.. It's a, a puffy shirt. (Leslie mumbles to Kramer) Well, yeah, it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.
Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.
(waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab.
Wait wait, hold it, hold it. Look who's over there. Don't look, don't look! It's Fred Savage.
(looks at his shirt as if he had a tie on) Oh man, you got mustard on your tie!
Huh-yah! (Kramer loses it and runs out past George, who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.)
I just assume not sit next to you.
Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the wrong license plates?
Well, I say we're going to take our money right now!
The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey) Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards.
Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.
Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.
(singing) ... It's a big, wild, funky mountain man ...
O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)
Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya.
Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on.
(crumpling a piece of paper) I don't wanna exclude anybody.
Yeah, I'm gonna keep these here too, huh? They'll be alright. (begins to leave)
I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) It would be nice if you got him something. (Punches the the table to accentuate this, and leaves.)
(To George) Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get my thoughts together.
Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?
(opens door) Uh--George, uh--uh--it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you..
(Trying to break up the fight) Uh.. Excuse me..
Oh yeah. Home-made pies, two hundred yards back.
Yeah! And get this I just got off the elevator with him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I said to him, like I, I was like this, I went, Oh, by the way, I know about the stuff.
Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes.
(stuttering gibberish, gestures that they should leave) A little... privacy, uh?
Well, lets just say I didnt take him to Peoples Court.
No, no, no. You gotta spend New Year's nineteen ninety-nine with me and Jerry.
Hey, you got to get this thing fixed.
I got news for you handicapped people, they don't even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces are always empty.
He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum?
You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor)
Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're clean?
(loudly) Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.
So, so what do you want me to do?
Well, I'm staining my floors, y'know, I don't want to get my hands dirty...
Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance.
You know what I did? I snubbed her.
We've been betting on arrivals and departures. (Newman rolls eyes) But I'm down $3200 , so you've gotta get me some cash.
You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything.
Ahh, no, no, no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself of things. It's fun. Very monastic.
He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...
Okay. A little later, we're gonna be talking with animal expert, Jim Fowler.
But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh.
Bette is recuperating right now and I'm not going to allow anything to disturb her.
No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. The millennium. I told you about that.
Well what happens if I can't play like I was? What about the tour, and all my dreams?
(enters apartment, holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! (inserts tape into VCR, sets up TV)
She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus?
"You know.. You really shouldn't brush 24 hours before seeing the dentist."
Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive. Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it. 8173.
Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didnt like it.
Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!
Alright, that's enough out of you, there's still three more games left in this series, my friend, and it's far from being over. Very far from being over. (Notices a car coming right towards Puddy, who's crossing the street) Watch out!
I know it's not what the ladies like. But without some solid sack time, I'm a zombie.
Y-ea (pours a few more Junior Mints into his hand and eats them)
Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen.
Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on a monkey! I'll check back with you.
Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?
No, I'd be happy to. He's a friend of mine.
It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushions didn't have any fabric on it.
Let's turn the radio on. Maybe there's a news report about it.
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut. How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years. All right, eh. (heading in)
Okay, Im gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat.
Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?
Come on, did you ever read one of these?
Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat!
When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month, he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and >pfffft< disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!
I'm not joking. She looks like Lyndon Johnson.
Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave it for me, huh?
See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez.
(Pointing at the dog) Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out.
(Frantic) Kramer, Kramer! I got big trouble with the - with the Van Buren Boys.
Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)
If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I can make things very unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one.
Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.
Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.
(emphatic) You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot 'em, that's all. (puts an arm round Lloyd's shoulder) Not crazy.
No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything.
(to Elaine) You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup?
Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These guys don't have it.
(shouting) Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees!
Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.
So listen, I'm going to crab a bite to eat at Sardi's. You wanna go?
I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian? It's unseemly.
I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.
(pointing to the newspaper ad) Well, I don't really have any money. But it says right here, 'interesting trades considered'.
Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.
Hey! (indicating photos) So what d'you think? You like it?
Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)
Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.
Jerry, that voice is tattooed on my brain, I'm telling you it's her
(screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT,
Okay.. (To Elaine) Well, I, Uh.. I like to work in the evenings.. (Elaine slumps back, and covers her head in misfortune)
Na, you're way way way off.. Well, yeah that's the right number but this is an apartment
Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. (TURNS TO LIBRARIAN) So uh, what's a guy got to do around here to get a library card?
Oh... So, what did you pay for this?
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.
Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packin' tight! (Puts the snowball on the table, then drips water from Jerry's cup onto it)
And we all know how painful that can be. (as he says this, he turns and speaks directly into the non-existent television camera. Jerry looks a bit confused.)
Oh, come on! What am I gonna do? She's going to eat me alive.
I don't know, we have a certain chemistry
George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man...
Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy.
I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.
Ya know I hate to brag but, uh, I did win eleven straight golden gloves.
Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?
Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there?
Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?
All right, Im satisfied. We better get some gas.
Let's see.. (studies them) oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (Turns to Jerry) masculine.
(walking out) Cause I know what happened, Jerry. (remembering something and walking back in) Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets?
(moody) Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends.
Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.)
Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. (Olive shows her long finger nails) Whoa.
All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab.
It's all fresh. Fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. I buy it, I omniga nominga, I eat it.
Chunnel's on HBO tonight. Why don't you stop by?
No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where I want to be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew.
Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.
(emerging from the changing room) Well, I don't mind if I do.
Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?
(still outside) Helowwwowwow (Estelle opens the door) Hey (kisses Estelle hello) Ha ha, Good evening (George waves)
Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.
Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the...
I got it. We'll kidnap him . and we'll drop him off Upstate and this way he won't bother you anymore and he won't get hurt.
Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition.
I got down in my knees and went, "Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, I love you!"
No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke "the covenant of the keys."
I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too?
(annoyed that he forgot) Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that!
(leafing through Jerry's mail) Oh, who sent you a card?
Jerry Im so glad we switched apartments. It was a perfect solution.
I just found a guy whos willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.
Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. The shave is close and clean, and the natural emolients keep my skin silky-smooth. Now feel my face.
( fake laugh ) Look Hubert. It's the mailman. You remember the mailman don't you.
So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?
Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.
Hey, I'm going to get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy. You see.
Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, "That's what I thin k of your party."
Well, let's see speeding, running a red light, no license, no registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah. (gives George a ticket)
I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.
I thought you said it was a scratch.
Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come - - (motions for Jerry to move down one seat as the new guest has arrived for her segment. Kramer gives Jerry a little push) Come on sit down. Yes.
The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights.
Did you enjoy the duck? (Elaine comes back from the bathroom.) Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night.
Do you think that thisll make you happy? Cause it wont!
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what would make a great coffee table book? A coffee table book about coffee tables! Get it?
Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cookin and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back!
Well, I'm not saying that! You know, things are going pretty well for me here. I met a girl...
(Points to a page on the book) Squamous cell carcinoma.
"Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for." (Pleased by the note, Kramer stumbles into his car).
What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque.
Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling like this only happens once a year.
Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any room for it all.
Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby got promoted!
Now see the two of you need to work on trust... and then and only then will there be a free exchange of sex and discounts.. Cornerstones of a healthy relationship....and now if you would (taps twice on the door) excuse us. We need to get to bed.
(gets back on the bus, yelling) Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs. Ladies and Gentlemen you're in for an additional treat. We're going to extend the tour at no extra charge.
I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. It's like a ski lodge.
Give me it..( tries to pull them off George's head)
So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?
Hey buddy. I am waiting for my shirt.
So I listened to my katra and now <vreep> I'm dominating the dojo. I'm class champion.
That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up.
Loan her the money. You can afford it.
Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her.
All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?
Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.
Oh, so far, so good...(looks at Mr. Kruger's shoulder) yeuye...
I still dont understand what the problem is having her in the building.
I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?
Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?
Wait, wait, . . .y-yea, w-no dit dit g- (Kramer noises)
Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by Joe Peppitone. Um, built during the Civil War so the northern armies could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh, yeah. Giddyup. On Rusty!
We've officially bottomed out, mm. Who's our next guest?
(Closing door) The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.
You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.
I gotta go find this kid. So all you gotta do is lay here, pretend you're asleep in case she gets back, here (grabs the covers and throws em over Mickey) keep the covers over ya.
Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll. See, keep the big bills on the outside.
Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.
Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate.
(keen) What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?
Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she-Jerry.
(going into his apartment) Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww!
Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said 'Sonny boy, take a good look at him, that's gonna be you some day.'
I just can't get over how fantastic you look.
Yah, yah! You see in Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was!
Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me.
(rushed) Yea, Hey. (Kramer enters.) Um, you wanted to see me Father?
(Taking his pair off, he inspects them) Aw, beautiful!
That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.
Hey Frank, you got two beds in here.
Jerry these are load bearing walls, they're not gonna come down!
(to tourists) Hey, are you folks from Japan.
Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.
Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!
George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean.
Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland? I've driven you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete annihilation.
Come on Jerry. Aren't you going to join us?
Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?
Well then we saw this woman, and she was wearing a bra with no top.
George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the dance. She sends you an enticing photo, you send her one right back.
I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!
Ah!! I found a quarter. Anybody want there clothes heated up?
(Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!
So thats the bedroom. Heres the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchenYeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers.
(To Newman) See, we should've gotten some collateral from him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans.
Uh, uh, you see thats the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?
[In Newman's ear] I find you extremely ugly...
(Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue)
Newman. (On the other side of the bookcase, Newman preens proudly.)
Well, if we're all set to go, why don't you two hop aboard and let me show you a little taste of old New York...the way it once was. Oh, happy anniversary. On, Rusty!
I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow.
I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.
Yeah, because she's throwing off my whole sleep. She's got the jimmy legs.
Ah, well I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live.
Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival, the sites, sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm
Giddy-up. Ok, uh, (Looks at a woman wearing dark sunglasses and sitting on a sofa behind him. He reacts oddly) Um. I need to talk to someone.
...Well, actually uh, we're uh, we're not friends Uh, we're uh, we're much more than friends...
Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.
(holds up framed picture) There she blows! (throws paper around)
So, uh, well, maybe I should just be honest with her, huh?
"Wellhum....He th'aid I gotta cut out the SsssfKittles."
So you don't know where you got 'em?
There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?
Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to.
Alright.. How do you like this? (Pulls out one of his eyebrows) Ya!
(Petting Smuckers) Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him. (Starts coughing)
Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name..
Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.
I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.
He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags.
Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?
Yeah, sure, um, oh boy, . . .
Yeah. Oh, here, wait wait (walks a few steps to catch up to her as she stops) Ah, maybe you could ah, use this (he searches through his jacket) Ah, here, it's a electronic organizer...
No no, he's never met her. She's in California.
Federal Express? Of course. That's the oldest trick in the book. You know it might not be a burglar it could be a murderer.
You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.
(to 'mental phone') Oh, you wanna talk to Jerry?
Are you leaving? Cause I got you covered.
Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.'
Yeah, I'll talk to Jerry. Yeah, [Hangs up] . . . you know that was Michael and Carol. She's wondering when we're going to come over and see the baby.
(voice; yelling) Toby! (Shot of a shocked Kramer is shown) Oh, Oh!
All right Come on....again attempts to pull headphones off)
No , no no no no. Weddings are a great place to meet chicks. I have to be unfettered.
So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing.
The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth.
Well, I ah, gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?
Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The infrastructure, Jerry, it's crumbling.
Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here.
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. (feminine grunts and sighs can be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape? (silence) Well, I'll take that as a yes.
well it all depends on what you mean by.. happen
(animated) Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to have me!
I'm not going to let you. If you don't call him I will.
Then why the sniffing? Who walks around (sniff, sniff) sniffing?
Now look here, see it's right here Gloria Vanderbilt Collection.
Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know, (makes a noise) they block it! So, I lunged for the bathroom. (demonstrates) I grab the knob - Occupado! Then they back me up agains the cartoon map of Italy, and all of the sudden, they just stop.
Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta do is be there at seven?
I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head?
(stops again) Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. (leaving)
Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?
(impressed) Ohh, you're good. You are really good.
Hey. (walking over to Jerry, who sits at the table reading the newspaper)
Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a shower.
Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride.
Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits beside Jerry) They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room.
I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I-I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut.
Ya well, theres no bet if Im not doing it.
(exhales) Well, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?
(entering Jerry's apartment) Will you look at this? More catalogs! 'Omaha Steaks', 'Mac Warehouse', 'Newsweek'?! I can't stop all these companies, so, I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point.
Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?
Look, do you want me to get it back or not?
No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. (leaving)
I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.
Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?
Why don't you park in front of the hydrant?
(bumping into a lamp) Alright, excuse me. Uh wait, wait.
(chuckling) Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that.
(offended) 'Literally'? What's THAT supposed to mean? (then to Jerry, before Elaine can answer) You mind if I hide this somewhere?
Alright! Alright. I'm getting off! I'm gonna go on the ramp.
(to the phone) Look, I'll call you back. (hangs up)
"Well I take 'em........They give me a Whooooosh."
You don't eat Oreos? (acts out eating Oreos) The way you break them open? You're (does a bunch of licking motions) ~ practically having sex with them.
Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all.
(enters) Well... I've had it with these jackbooted thugs!
I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.
Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice.
That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for $400.
Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels.
Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy.
They wont take a cage full of birds.
Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal.
Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...
Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?
They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.
Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?
Theres no dinner. The bets off. Im not gonna do it.
Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office..
All right lets take a look to see what we got ( examines George's head) Wait a second.. I think I see something here George. Lets go to the videotape.
Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.
Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George.
