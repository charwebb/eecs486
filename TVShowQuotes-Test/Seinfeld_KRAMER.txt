It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for ya.
Why did you get rid of that sausage?
No, no. That ain't dancing, Sally.
Brody's in.
It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Git gt gt.
What advice would you give young people?
The Netherlands?
(emotionally) She's deep.
Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?
Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.
Come on, just look at me. Tell me I'm not Kramer.
Hey
No no no. I got all my appointments up here. (he points to his head)
Why doesn't he just move in here?
Okay. What are you getting?
(frantically pulling at his doorknob) Thank god you're home. I'm wiped out. I drop my car at Jiffy Park and I forgot to take my apartment keys off the ring. So you got my spare?
Why not?
Cause they look comfortable.
She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus?
..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts the door behind him)
Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.
Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!
Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.
Hey.
(entering, handing Jerry a piece of paper) This was in front of your door.
Yeah.
What's an extremity?
What are you looking for?
Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.
So, okay uh whats the problem?
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?
Yeah, yeah. I wonder hmm.
Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.
Yeah..
The board, Jerry. We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but he's gotta go.
Last week. When I, you know, gave you the phone. Hes really into my pizza place idea!
Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside!
Alright! Alright. I'm getting off! I'm gonna go on the ramp.
Hey buddy. Remember me?
You can have this one.
See that was nice, Jerry. (under breath) Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.
Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?
Yeah ... backstage.
And?
Never!
What took you so long? Hey, Ping!
So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, "Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."
Jerry, check this out. (Pointing at some papers on the table) Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen!
Uh, you need any help, or..?
Yeah, yeah, right. (walks out)
Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...
(Walking away) I knew it.. Stupid Jerry..
Well, why not.
Ooh! Test tubes. Cool!
Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs.
Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone.
A pig-man. Half pig, half man!
It's me!
Well, what we have here, doctor, is uhm, an extraordinary situation.
Well, doesn't he need that?
Eh! Bingo.
Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?
Well, they're slim-fit.
Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, laundry's pilin' up there. You might want to tell your girlfriend. Mmm. Yeah.
Jerry, that voice is tattooed on my brain, I'm telling you it's her
Help me Father. Help me.
No no, he's never met her. She's in California.
(impatient sigh) You don't have a problem.
But she really looks like a Lily
let me go. let me go. Because I haven't talked to my mother in five years. We just don't see eye to eye. I don't even want to get into my childhood. I'm still carrying a lot of pain. A LOT of pain.
You shut up!
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, "Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!"
Yeah, there, all right I said it there.. Ya' satisfied? Anything else you want to know?
Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system.
Yeah, hello, Jerry's place.
Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're clean?
Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?
Well Rudy's the guy buying Morty's raincoats.
That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.
Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.
Im not happy about this.
Yippie-yi-yay!
You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen.
There's nothing in there that I haven't seen before.
(Ow!) It's my stomach.
Hey Jerry, you got any Tums?
Heads up!
Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.
Jerry, your palate's unrefined.
Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like yourself. (Elaine enters)
Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a premiere.
(to George) What's with you?
Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe.
Jerry, you gotta help me!
make me an offer.
(grabs briefcase to leave) I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. (leaves)
In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in men's fashion.. It's a, a puffy shirt. (Leslie mumbles to Kramer) Well, yeah, it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?
Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?
Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He gets it from his butcher.
GO! GO!!
Let's go.... OK. (he snaps the towel at Naomi's backside) GOTCHA.
No, I think these Jockeys shrunk.
Jerry!
Oh, I can wait..
Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant.
Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable texture. You'd never know it was non-fat.
My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect.
I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian? It's unseemly.
Yeah, yeah. (Pulls a bottle out of his pocket) I got some pilss. They taste terrible.
Yeah, it's a disturbing image.
Probably. Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.
Ooooh... You stink.
(Still laughing) That's true.. (Gets up) I'll be right back. (Walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low-talker. A moment passes)
Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his antics.
Where do I know that guy from?
So, what's your talent?
Mickey, Mickey he hooked me up. He's a member of the academy.
Well I think I take a normal sip.
Oh, you have no idea.
Como se dice.. waterbed?
Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. (Pulls it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.
My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit!
(to Jerry) Hey buddy.
Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh! I know what I think. I think you're gaga over this dame. She's twisted you around her little finger, and now, you're willing to sell me, and Elaine, and whoever else you have to, right down the river.
Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. (Poppie enters.)
I'm not going if he's going.
Hey, Georgie, I saw you on TV yesterday.
Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.
Well, you're getting heavy.
(Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show!
Anyway, she asked me to apologize to Barry.
Hey, are you performing tomorrow?
Yeah.
And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees.
What a body. Yeeaahh. Thats for me.
Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh?
Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out.
Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?
"What?"
Well its, uh, well its too hard to keep up, you know, they were tired.
Thank you.
Wait, wait, wait, now... He's throwin them out??
He's gonna make us very happy.
Here. I write it down. (he writes) "One cupcake." And then I put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and drops it into the bowl) There. Very simple.
What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' CRAZY in these things! (leaves)
(Adding) Jerry, she's a loser. (George points to Kramer - gesturing that he's right on target)
I don't like it.
"Yeaheum ... You're not doing too bad yourself"
Uhh.. no thanks. (Goes back out the door)
Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's house in the country. They find it and adopt it. Now the dog is prancing in the fields. Dancing and prancing. Fresh air. . Dandelions. We're doing this dog a huge favor.
Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency callbox seven-eight-four.
What? It's a beautiful day.
Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.
I want restitution.
Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now.
Lindsay olives, Jerry.
No!
Well, this is a surprise ha?
Well, how did they get your face?
Y-ea (pours a few more Junior Mints into his hand and eats them)
I still dont understand what the problem is having her in the building.
yeah., but he wouldn't give me the money.
Oh, I'll be back.
Oh, hey, how you doing?
Ohh, it's Hanaran now, is it?
(quietly) Hey Jerry.
Brown?
Huh?
No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.
You keep him busy.
Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now. (he rushes back into the theater)
Hey.
I, Okay, okay. I'm not reneging.
Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee.
What are they gonna do?
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
Yeah! Ooh! (leaves again)
How did they ever find you?
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight.
Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.
Hey. Well, I just spoke to your girlfriend.
(offering the artichoke can) 'Choke?'
That's East River.
Are you still on the pill?
(does a double take) Yikes.
(impressed) Ohh, you're good. You are really good.
He thinks you're a phony.
I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are pretty good odds.
Oh I'll take these.
Uhm...
Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten this thing out.
Well, please?
Well that's a burgeoning continent.
alright, who's gonna tell her
No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables.
(interupts involuntarily) Yo-yo Ma!
Well, that's how cats do it.
Alright, come on, Newman. Now you gotta help me! What am I gonna do about FDR?
Come on. Are you sure?
Oh, yeah, yeah. (feeds tape into VCR) Well, you guys just watch the tape and, uh, I'll get you some food.
no problem, ... no problem. [Hangs up] ... How did YOU know who that was?
Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?
Right.... Don't mention my name
Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know anybody who can help me cook?
So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All you gotta do it jiggle it (has is hand out jiggling) jus get it in there (jiggling making a bunch of noises) jigg jigg jiggle reiggle
Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you.
Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in.
Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New York City.
I've got plenty of ideas.
Oh, lots of 'em.
Oh. I'll lug.
Get out of here.
But that's not Hello.
Why not? hey what about you George?
Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table.
That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.
Nothin'.
What?
So? I'm innocent! I mean you guys believe that I'm innocent, don't you? Jerry? George?
I mean when he was leaving did he say "I'm splittin'"?
(makes a zipper gesture to his mouth) ..Weeeeeepp!!
Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packin' tight! (Puts the snowball on the table, then drips water from Jerry's cup onto it)
Sand! It's like sleeping on the beach.
Well, look at that. A talking Nixon.
what?
Jerry...
(happy, enthused) We're takin' George back--
E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams, holograms.
"Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together."
Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.
Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.
No paper?
Not as many as there used to be.
Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, "That's what I thin k of your party."
(quiet) Okay.
(tossing car keys to Jerry) Yeah.
Hey hold that bus!
(smelling) What's burning?
(claps his hands) Here's our chance. What d'you say? It'll be me, you and the bro, bro.
Well, I tell you there's only one problem.
Jerry, you gotta give him some credit. (starts rubbing a stick of Jerry's butter across his face) You're just being totally ridiculous. (keeps rubbing) I'll see you later buddy.
Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?
Uh, no, see, my friend already bought me a ticket. I'm late, and she's inside.
Do I think? He's repugnant.
Oh yeah!
Want some mango?
Here, take my Jockey shorts.
So, I'll uh... all right. (Hangs up)
Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there.
Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.
Fifteenth , Yes last day for the Macanaws. I can still make it. Wait.. Newman...
We need a new format. We should shut down and re-tool.
Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit. Here you go...
Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package.
Look at you! You've got another gig! Uhh.
Price club.
I wanna see it.
Yeah... I do great, yeah.
Oh, I forgot. (Hands back Jerry's can opener.)
that's right......Aye oooh!! ...Right now.
I say Japan.
Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.
When you getting it back?
Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again.
Yaaaa.
That's nice..
Yeah, that's a hall of famer.
I get to play Kramer.
(Looking at map) Hey, where, where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map... what...
I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.
Ya
(prodding Jerry) C'mon buddy.
Whatever you get.
Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat!
No, I mean it, man. I'm lost!
Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left
Yeah. So long, Morty.
Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.
It felt like 8 seconds.
What tonight?
What's going on?!
Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas everyone. Merry Christmas.
(Watching Rusty's pulling of the rickshaw) Giddy up! Good form.
No.
I came by to get my ball.
Oh...yeah!
(animated) Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to have me!
Little Snowball? He runs on batteries!
God.
Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice.
And go we will.
You're all right
Who could love me?
Yeah. Nice meeting you.
It's weighing on my conscience.
(high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.
Oh, I gotta go move the car. Alright (Leaves)
The AC is on it's way.
iIs it? Or is it so possible your heard is spinning like a top?
Hey.
Wait a minute, Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?
(taping Morty's glasses) Morty, what're you lookin' at?
Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated, hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws. (One of the homeless men starts to wander off, walking away) Now, I don't caer where you're from, or how you got here, or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit.
All right look, I am going to have to pay you back later. I don't have my wallet.
Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing?
Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?
Well, that guy who yelled out.
Yeah, and I'll tell ya something else. Stan's advice has transformed my game. He's never wrong. Oh, he thinks eventually I'll have a shot at making it big on the senior tour. (sucks in air through tight lips) Oh, that's my dream, Jerry.
No, I'm the baby-sitter.
I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh...
Oh?
Hey. Hey Elaine, what do you say if neither of us is married in ten years, we get hitched?
Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.
They're ladies' glasses.
Yeah.. (Heads for FDR's)
Yeah, I've seen them do that.
Mine was better than that! Come on look. (starts to laugh again, Jerry too)
Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now.
Everything she thinks. you think. Everything you think she thinks. No I can't take it. I can't take it Jerry. It's too much. It's too much.
You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in your head.
So, you sleep in separate beds.
Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Jerry, I'll take care of it.
Yello?
A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell it privately.
Oh, the Tony's. I'll see you there buddy.
You know you hurt the Maestro's feelings.
Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.
Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her.
Well, they're in...
I left a Macanaw peach in your refrigerator.
How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot of other stuff. Oh, yyyeeah.
Oh, well, no rush. (wipes his nose) Uh oh.
What do you mean, a broad noodle?
The machine. You want one?
Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you believe this Maestro?
Oh, yeah.
Hmm.
Hey, let's go inside the liquor store. Im freezin in here.
"Go Jimmy"
No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year..
Ah, the mother lode! (the door squeaks a bit as he pushes it open)
I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.
hey George, hear that?
Alright, alright, I'll follow him.
What is it?
ho ho ho ho.
Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass frames?
Well. Sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear, wedding bells?
Oo, y- what are you doing with her? (Jerry ignores him and exits)
Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre?
So you don't think it's a good idea?
I don't know it's up to you.
Uh? Voila.
Well, I practically raised his kids.
You should just eat fruit.
Like a rock concert. Whatever you like.
Jerry, ah? Breakfast on me, huh?
Why don't you get a "death in the family" fare?
Hot and spicy.
Hey, Georgie.
Pine is good.
Whoa, you're dating this woman?
No, I'd be happy to. He's a friend of mine.
Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite.
Oh you'll be ok. I'll see you later.
Steven.
Come on. What'd he say?
I got time.
Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen.
Yeah. That's them.
Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here?
Well, I don't think they're real.
Jerry, what are you doing? George tells me you're gonna throw your set?
Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?
Put that on the top of your list.
Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!
Look, you gotta do me a favor.
An In The Park Home Run!
Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it.
Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.
Oh.
Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.
Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and I'll get it back to you as soon as I can.
Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.
Giddy-up.
How's your evening?
(enthusiastic) Oh, I'm percolating, Jerry. I'm telling you, I have never felt so fertile. I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy. Listen to this idea. (fetches a spoon from the drawer) A restaurant that serves only peanut butter and jelly. (clicks tongue)
Aw, I'm beaming Jerry.
It's cucumbers.
(animated) She tried to kill me Jerry!
What happened to the doll?
Oh yeah, you talked to her.
Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.
Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.
Well yeah, yeah. He could build the rocket, but-but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.
You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free.
What?
You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.
Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester country club. Mmh.
Ah, that makes sense, that's a good call, Stan. Alright, we'll see you guys later, huh?
Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, this-this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate!
Hey. These are for you Olive.
But that's the idea, you make your own pie.
Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your beef?
Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have they changed your shower head?
Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here.
No. (indicates with his head) (noise again) Ditadidatidat.
See, that stinks. You cant eat that. You should take that back.
Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.
Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?
And to the bathroom.
Oh, you better believe it!
Who's that?
(picking up Jerry's old racquet) Well, you're not gonna need this any more.
You stink. (He exits)
What banking?
Ooh. Well, this is uh, risky business, huh? I'm all a-twitter.
Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation. Went to Baltimore.
That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.
So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?
They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture. (gleeful) These clothes won't last five years without 'em.
Heyyyy! (bangs the table in frustration and grabs the key)
Jerry, come on. What'd you say?
I'm talking about the thirty percent discount.
So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of emotions.
MUST be banker.
I told you this is all I got.
Oh, you're poo-pooing!
Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the gonorrhea themselves.
It's all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerry's)
Oh, yes.
Heyy! Look who's here.
Here you go brother. Some food for you.
Now that's a great looking shirt! (Gets up, admiring the shirt) Aye Captain! (Growls like a pirate) Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect. (Walks around Jerry, inspecting the shirt) Look at it! It's fantastic!
You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? you're wearing.
Hey!
Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)
You got any pliers?
You want to sit here?
I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I-I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut.
Erika is gonna meet me here, now we're gonna find out the truth
No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?
Cool it lady ( they struggle and we here a siren)
So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing.
Elaine
Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered.
Well you can go to your room and read.
Leapin' Larry! Yeah, that's where I bought this.
(shouts) Connie!
(to a fleeing Audrey) Where are you going?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, geez..
Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
You wanna go see him?
Yeaaahmm....
Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here?
Hello, twelve dollars.
What do you mean "wrong kind of medicine"?
Newman! Newman!!
Wrong again.
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?
Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE!
Oh yeah - oui oui.
(continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.
Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?
She was flouting.
(Struggling) Hey!
I don't know.
Toxic gas!!!
So now, what's this got?
Look out below!!
Hey, is that T-bone?!
I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.
What's that red dot on your sweater?
I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff...
Defective.
Somebody got killed while they had me in custody.
Let me see you do it.
Its all manipulated with junk bonds. You cant win.
The bank can pay 'em.
Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that.
What time do you need it at?
No.
Well, there's only one way to settle this. (Starts pointing back and forth between Newman and him with each word of the rhyme) One spot, two spot, zig, zag, tear, pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scare 'em, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe..
Alright I'll uh, I'll call her at home. (To man waiting behind him) Go ahead, it's all yours.
we would have had all that bridge traffic.
Well, I say we're going to take our money right now!
Oh, I get by.
What?
Yeah!
Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.
That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.
This was set for 2 minutes. See?
Good one? It's the Commando 8.
Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..
Yeah.
Oh yeah right it's raining.
(looking at a map) I don't know. (over the speaker) Uh, no more questions.
Then we're cool.
Newman?
George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.
(Taking his pair off, he inspects them) Aw, beautiful!
Hey, you got to get this thing fixed.
Heyy, wasn't that a pie stand back there?
Yeah. Where's yours?
Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go check it out.
Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah.
All right, lets go.
Ya I told you.
It's Keith.
Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right?
Ah, you look like a cowboy! Huh?
(re buzzer box) What are you doin'?
(TO GEORGE) Pink eleven. Remember that.
Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.
(walking into Jerry's apartment with a fresh black eye) You got a steak?
I thought I heard you.
(Excited) Done!
Too much?!
My whole lot?
(suddenly entering) Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--
Well, we talked about a lot of things.
Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.
Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're gonna cut him open -- His guts'll be all over the place...
Don't really remember.
So, uh, what did you want to see me about?
I guess I screwed up huh Jackie?
Well, where's the soup?
Phew!
Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!
Yeah, but before I met up with her, I stopped to look at the monkeys, when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel. I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I *whap* let him have it.
(entering the condo, and going to the fridge as if he's a neighbor) Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?
Oh, come on, Jerry! Come on, this is stupid! It's six o'clock! It's all over, just pick up the phone and thank him!
(seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his head, escorted by a security man) Geez. Newman?
Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah.
Mmm, these are good, huh?
(laughs) Oh hey, you know Elaine, ah she stopped by...
Yes she is...
Hey, you got the food?
Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair.
What?
Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!
His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself.
Oh, mama.
I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.
Yeah, I'd like to cancel my mail.
You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.
Jerry, you're not in show business. You don't know what these people are like.
What?
Right.
Hey, you got a hammer?
Those kids look pretty disappointed.
Ohhh!
It's got to be here.
(Between coughs) Hey.
Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight.
well it all depends on what you mean by.. happen
No. No, he can't do that.
Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.
(To Jerry) Hey, you watchin' Oprah?
(singing) Johnny Yuma was a rebel, Yeah! ...
And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!! this is eerie.
Well what happens if they want to see it?
Oh, it's on file, right here. (points to his head)
Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area.
(to tourists) Hey, are you folks from Japan.
You know I can't find a match anywhere.
Yes
Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?
But it's Festivus.
Well, thank you.
I'm sure it'll come out.
Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know.
You know what you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical on Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.
Oh, Jerry, I'm *surprised* at you!
No, no. Cinqo de Mayo. (leaving) Yeah, Marcellino, he turned me on to it, and he's one sixty-fourth Mayan.
She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious. (Elaine drinks some water and drools) She's foaming at the mouth!
Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal.
(Standing up, greeting the men) Buenos dias.
Oohh.
Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit cover)
(Spraying his flowers) Hello, neighbor.
Cat fight?
No, it's statue.
She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.
Ah, Tony, he's good.
That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
(grabbing the sweater) Yeah.
Hi, Mike.
Its for you.
What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, (takes Jerry hand) hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy...
Watch out, boy.
Yayaya...
Uh, no.
Oh. (continuing to itch and scratch from the sand)
Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?
(From a phone booth right outside the store) Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.
(chuckling) Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that.
Vandelay.
Assman.
Oh. This is all burned up. Look at this.
Hey.
I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)
(animated) What? Sleeping with the fishes? I guess I woke up!
Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels.
You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?
Well, now what are we gonna do? (to Jerry) See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox.
(lost for words) Well you look like a Lily...
Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum.
Bad news, my friend.
Hey Jerry, you got any pepper?
(Looks at the bags on the floor) Evidently.
I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I got kugel working at Mrs. Zamfino's, this is kreplach. Here, try some of this.
Well how should I have "broached the subject"
You're on, cowboy!
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
The super has keys to your apartment. Don't you see what's going on? Newman is planning a sneak attack.
I still like to stop at the duty free shop.
(examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff? No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.
Jerry he's a conductor.
(shivering) Hypothermia.
Excuse me. What happened to the man, that was in this room before?
Hey.
...Yu uh, yes, yes uh, uh, Doctor Reston. Uhm well, hello there. Ahh yeah, well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's...
The first upper-body support undergarment, specifically designed for men.
Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on!
I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen.
Forty-eight.
Yeah.
Mail fraud. Your in a lot of trouble buddy.
Are those shoes comfortable?
...And you're the manager of the circus.
Go ahead, drink it, George.
Yo yo ma.
Meet, the bro.
Oh I got a big problem Jerry!
...and uh, she's very much in love with me, and uh, well uh, we would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist, and allow us to pursue our courtship unfettered.
I'm distraught!?! Wooh-wooh-hoo!
Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat and giggley.
I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.  I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.
All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.
Oh
(Finishing the story) I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!
Why?
Jimmy leg.
You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.
Common Jerry, this guy is crazy. Get out.
Oh, I, I need a pen.
What?
Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....
"Ah! what.. Tim Whatley?
Well, we're not very close.
Hey.
So, how you feeling?
Call him and tell him
"Eh!! Cosmo Kramer. Nice to meet you"
Whoa, psychosexual.
Awright, hands up, porky!
(quietly) Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.
He's ripping me off
(lighting his own cigar) Well, that's very kind of you.
Why?
(clattering inside) That wasn't me!
I'll just snag the lock with this. auhh Here we go...
Hey, I told you.
Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage disposal?
Well, is it good?
That's right.
Some nut in a clown suit!
Phew.
Now calm down, Mr. Fields...
NNNN-Giddy-up!
Here, take one.
