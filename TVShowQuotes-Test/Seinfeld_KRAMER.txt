(to a fleeing Audrey) Where are you going?
Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy.
Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!
Oh... So, what did you pay for this?
Thank - you! (Gets his coat, and leaves)
Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer hands out the hot dogs)What a great day!
Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus.
Wait, wait, wait, now... He's throwin them out??
Oh. Yeah, I been getting HBO and Showtime for free. See, they just found out about it, so now they wanna come and take it out.
Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours.
Well it was an accident. Right Jerry it was an accident. Ah, she's going to be all right. .. baby, baby, ah, baby.
Maybe uh, it needed some air. You know sometimes they need air, they can't breathe in there. It's in human.
That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again.
A LOT of 'em! (wild gesture, freaked out) Do you think maybe I'm... Depleted??!!
The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces together) Yeah.
(taking notes on showering men at the YMCA) Now see, that's smart. Constant motion. Wow.
What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.
Look, Jerry, Im sorry, Im uh- you have insurance, right buddy?
Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?
Each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight.
I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?
When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month, he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and >pfffft< disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!
Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing.
Yeah, I've seen you in everything you've done.
Hey, I'll tell you what, Chubs, if that yogurt has fat in it, I will put myself on an all-yogurt diet for a week.
All right now here's the list. (hands Jerry the list)
Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother... (thinks for a second) ...Dennis.
No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.
Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs.
(running to the window) What?! Not my car!! Hey!! They're towing my car!!
It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich.
You gonna share it with me next time, huh?
The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.
(pointing) Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused. (convulses in pain) Waahh! Oh, mama!
So Jerry, (smacks hands and rubs palms together) What time we going to the movies?
I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning!
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.
We just got back from breakfast. The pancakes were dynamite.
(checks dial) I got enough to get to Memphis.
Yeah, yeah. (Getting out of the car) Well, Ill think about it..
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?
You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there.
No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you.
Yeah, I'll talk to Jerry. Yeah, [Hangs up] . . . you know that was Michael and Carol. She's wondering when we're going to come over and see the baby.
Ohh, He's got a big sweat going. (Takes an envelope out of his pocket.) Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents.
"No, no I don't find him all that bright."
They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.
Well you know all my life I've been running away from that name. That's why I wouldn't tell anybody. But I've been thinking about it. All this time I'm trying not to be me. I'm afraid to face who I was. But I'm Cosmo Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer. And that's who I'm going to be. From now on that's who I'm going to be. I'm Cosmo!
Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home.
Alright we gotta get back to the show. What are you guys doing?
(walking into Jerry's apartment with a fresh black eye) You got a steak?
Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in.
Uh, borrow. Its for my friend. Yeah, hell be buying..
Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must walk among them.
And you're going to go out with her.
We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper with it.
Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking.
Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!
(halfheartedly) Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya.
It's a golf club! It's no gun. He threw a golf club at me!
From now on, I'll be calling the shots around here...
(Continuing as if nothing happened) Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body.
Ya know I hate to brag but, uh, I did win eleven straight golden gloves.
Yeah, well, what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx.
No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital. I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits.
Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.
Hes got all of my attachments, you know.
What does it look like I'm doing? What?
Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE!
(fidgety) Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh.
Man, I'm going to be hitting the links all weekend. Ffoooo (Taking an imaginary swing, he makes the sound of a golf ball being hit)
Look, George, I can't help ya, all right.
Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... we got Jim Fowler!
No, I really think you're wrong. We just went to the fireworks the other day.
Federal Express? Of course. That's the oldest trick in the book. You know it might not be a burglar it could be a murderer.
Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her.
Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. (points to plate) Proctology.
(listens) Uh, yes. Uh uh, Doctor uh, Reston, is he in? Well, this is Kramer and uh, he's expecting my call.
I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. (gets up) I'll be right back.
Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, is the job too difficult? (Jerry nods) What, you don't have enough experience? (Jerry shakes his head) Oh, you're not smart enough? (Jerry shakes his head) Where's your confidence? (Jerry shrugs his shoulders) Look, Elaine, let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate...
(fearful) There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes.
What do I need to talk for.. ha!, For to blab to the neighbors about George has a new fem-Jerry friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop ho George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend. See now, I've done all that.....Now it's time for silence.
They just don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got us to Yankee Stadium in rush hour in fifteen minutes?
He's got money. Why doesn't he just pay a mover?
Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then again, I've been known to do a lot of things. (Waiter opens the counter which hits Kramer on the head) Cigarette?
Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate other women, and they hate you.
Well, I'm just a little nervous. OK, I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me luck, huh?
No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year..
Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! (Laughs.)
Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.
So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off.
Well I got a cut on my head and I banged my shoulder. (He has a large Band-aid on his forehead)
And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis.
If a guy saved your life you'd be in love with him too.
Whew, chicks man. Too many chicks know my number.
Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while.
Well I knew you'd regret it for the rest of your life.
(To Newman) Well, I just assumed you would.
Well, I'm staining my floors, y'know, I don't want to get my hands dirty...
Yeah, now and then - you know how it is..
(to the phone) Oh, theyve got a cure for cancer. See, its all big business. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (to the phone again) Yeah yeah yeah yeah take my number. 555-8643. Okay, here he is.
All right, all right, I'll see ya later. (shuts door)
No. And now I can't get it back.
Sorry I couldnt get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his "intern")
Now look here, see it's right here Gloria Vanderbilt Collection.
Yeah, well, I could do it. I dont wanna do it.
Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.
Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room.
All right George, come on, take a look.
Hi. I'm goin' through this stuff like water... (to Jerry) Who you talkin' to? (Jerry waves him away and moves towards the bedroom, still on the phone)
A half hour then diving class started. Well that got a little messy. I gotta find a new place to swim 'cause that pooll can't hold me, Jerry.
Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.
Oh yeah. Home-made pies, two hundred yards back.
(Shrugging it off) Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line.. (Looks at Jerry, then leans in so Elaine can't hear) Plus, the botched my vasectimy.
Anything you wish. I'll tell you a little secret about zip codes They're meaningless! (Laughs evilly, driving away)
Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! (Jerry puts on his coat) This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it.
Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels.
Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me.
Oh you'll be ok. I'll see you later.
(points over to Jerry) You recognise that mug?
I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away.
I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby.
Yeah, well, you got that straight! (Turns to Elaine) Hey, Elaine, try the beef - because that's realy au jus sauce, huh. (Dramatically) Real au jus sauce!
Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!
(Taking some of Jerry's clothing over to the kitchen) I see..
So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of emotions.
(seeing Elaine come into Jerry's apartment) Ten minutes? That's kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?
Oh, Vincent is an art-house goon. I stick to the Gene rack.
you know I think you are in love with him
Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now.
I got down in my knees and went, "Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, I love you!"
Common Jerry, this guy is crazy. Get out.
So? I'm innocent! I mean you guys believe that I'm innocent, don't you? Jerry? George?
Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop.
No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. The millennium. I told you about that.
As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a freeloader.
Well, what we have here, doctor, is uhm, an extraordinary situation.
Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's going to be right back, okay?
Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! (Rick is silent) Whew! Well, I think we stopped.
Well, I had some hard candy in there.
In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!
Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside, right into a horse.
My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit!
Uh.. ah, (Looks over at Elaine, and realizes he can't tell the Van Buren Boys story) Oh, nothing - nothing.. No, I certainly don't have any stories, if that's what you're implying. (Laughs heartily)
Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?
Come on, did you ever read one of these?
Hey, I ain't goin' to no Bellevue! Look at me, I'm fallin' apart here.
Yah, yah! You see in Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was!
Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it. (Leaves)
Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? None other than Miss Chita Rivera.
Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all *hopped* up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuffin' cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.
Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore.
Steady, steady, now calm yourself, come on, now get a hold of yourself,
So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!
Deh-deh-deh-deh- (Jane exits) All right, show's over. I'm goin' to the beach.
You're not gonna see 'em. I got a case of party poppers I'm gonna keep in front of 'em.
Oh ya, I think they are starting to loosen up a bit. (Mrs. Anvino come to Jerry's threshold) Oh hi Mrs. Anvino.
Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.
Hey. I uh, brought back your record player, huh.
You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that.
No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry.
Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Where'd he get those.
Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children?
Guess what? I saw Newman talking to the super.
I can't get my pants off, and Mickey's audition is in twenty minutes! You know, I'm supposed to be a business man, I gotta be in costume!
Hey everybody. (to Jerry) Listen, uh, do me a favour, will you? I got a hot date tonight with Connie. Knock on my door, wake me up in twenty minutes, alright?
Excuse me. What happened to the man, that was in this room before?
Hey, wheres your new jacket? (Jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom. Its ruined.) What? (Kramer enters the bathroom, and sees the garment.) Ohhh. What did you do to it?
He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum?
(taping Morty's glasses) Morty, what're you lookin' at?
Het, Mickey when do we get a break? My lap is killing me.
Here we go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!
Well, he pushed my buttons, I couldn't help it, Jerry.
Oh yea that feels good. Ahh, now I'm simmering.
Oh, there's action. There's plenty of action. That damned alien autopsy is stealing all the headlines.
If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000
(stuttering gibberish, gestures that they should leave) A little... privacy, uh?
What, are you kidding? Opening night Pavarotti and Pagliacci. Ha, we're gonna clean up!
No no no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day that's insane. They're heading straight into gridlock. Oh, those fools.
Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an "I am sorry" wave.
(to Jerry and George) Hey, it's Newman. (to 'mental phone') Hey, how you doing, Newman?
Oh, you didn't notice? It has a pee-stain.
Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!
You must be Aaron, I've heard about you.
(on the phone in the shower) Lomez, you're not listenin'. Jerry likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. Calm down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, I'll call ya back.
I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free time tomorrow afternoon?
Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose? YEA!
(ignoring them) Now.. This is the tape that we made earlier and I think, that I see. a couple of buds right here.
Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good combination.
(to Joel) Its gonna be hot in a minute.
You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.
(still trying to sit down, says under his breath) I'm trying. {hard to make out}
The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.
Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.
(to the Chinese delivery boy) How much do I owe you?
But what am I gonna do for fruit?
Yeah, that's cool. Well, you gotta support your team.
Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their own moles. Freckles that cover two men.
Yeah. There ya go. That's Beef-A-Reeno. (singing) I'm so keen-o On Beef-A-Reeno What a delicious cuisine-o Fit for a king and queen-o! Yeah. Eat up. I got thirty four more cans.
Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. (Heads for the door)
Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J
You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach
And how am I gonna do that, Toots?
You see Elaine, Billy was a simple country boy. You might say a cockeyed optimist, who got himself mixed up in the high stakes game of world diplomacy and international intrigue.
Hey! (indicating photos) So what d'you think? You like it?
No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card.
Books. (Knocks over a bowl of fruit on the counter.)
Listen uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food. There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa.
Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is your chance to make it all right again.
Yeah, it's baked on in. Hey, put another stick of butter in.
Well, why didn't you tell me about this?
(after delicately sniffing Elaine) Uh... that's not bad at all.
Because nobody does it like she does. She's the best.
What's going on? Hey, Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh?
You know what my feelings are about this. I don't even pay taxes.
I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.
I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
...Yeah I like Cadillacs (cautiously) Why ? What you got on your mind?
Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything Fires, harbor patrol, even the police. I'm watching the watchers, Jerry. Uh oh, we got a big fire on 115th. I tell ya if could do it over again, I'd give it all up to be a fireman.
What do I mean?.. Well perhaps he thinks that you're working him for the discount. Shaking that little butt of yours into big, big savings.... And then when you get it,you know, you drop him like a hot potato.
(Smiling) You bet we are! Huh, Smuckers? (Smuckers coughs. They turn to leave) I'll see ya.
I didn't have any quarters for the dryer. Anyway this is better. And it's more convenient.
Jerry, don't you see? This world here, this is George's sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's collide. You know what happens then?
It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.
The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two, fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time.
Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one-fourteen.
Ya' know, people who glitter. She's a slim gal.
Well, that makes sense. (Offers plate to Elaine) Want some chicken?
Well, you're fired because you don't move your arms when you tap dance, you're like a gorilla out there I've gotta go...
What me? Fabulous, just fabulous. I've got a lot of auditions, a lot of call backs and I've got a lot of interest for my movie treatment. I'm in development, I'm in developed vehicles. And there's a lot of energy here, man. You know, the vibe, it's powerful. I'm just swept up at it. Yeah, I'm a player.
Yeah, but why are you taking an IQ test for George?
I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way out there!
It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.
Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.
Well there is the possibility that you've gone right out of your mind.
(laughs too loudly) All right, let's take a short break.
What! (Kramer is back to his usual way of speaking)
You let go - come on ...(they fight over the items)
Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
You gotta come through with the hips first.
I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up.
Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits)
Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, this-this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate!
Yeah, Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.
And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back, it's killing me! (whining) It's killing me Jerry!
We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository.
Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you're crazy.
Armani? Hey, Armani Jerry. (Kramer takes the suit and looks it over)
Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time.
Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Boy he's lookin' good, huh Jerry?
Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left ear. What, you didn't know that?
Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. (whistles) That guy's coming home in a body bag.
Yeah, white meat. And if I see one piece of dark meat on there. It's your ass buster.
Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?
Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.
Um, yeah. (glances around the apt.) Oh, uh ... well, how's everything? (clap)
The name on the boat. Look at it.
(to George) Well listen See you later ..thanks for driving me by..
Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya.
Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh?
Listen, I need you to do me a favor.
Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Hey! Elaine. Go Like this. (imitating a mannequin posture)
Oh boy, that looks great. I can't believe you're giving him this.
So whadda ya think, Jackie? I mean we got a case?
Oh. This is all burned up. Look at this.
Oh, understudies are a very shifty bunch. The substitute teachers of the theater world.
Waited all year and I can't even taste it..
Come on.. Come on. Yes! (Sees a falling star) There's one! (Yelling out) I wish I don't drop dead!!
(looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?
Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?
So, somehow the Bronzo (?) is reacting to the poison she's giving you.
Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.
It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!
(Interested) Ooohh... That sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it. (Gets up and heads for the bathroom)
It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.
Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate.
Well you can go to your room and read.
Well, what, they got any golf courses up there?
Oh, well you have fun...(Elaine leaves) oh no clowns...hate clowns...the clowns.
Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.
(Frantic) No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! (Pleading) Now, come on. Please, Jerry. Please! I'm beggin' ya! Please! (Claps hands) Come on! Please!
(to Newman) Would you let me say it? Let me talk!
I told you I was gonna get it.
(Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue)
All right, I?ll tell you what I?ll do. Cause you look like a nice guy, a thousand dollars for the duce.
(Coughs) Hey. How's everybody? (Moves to the kitchen)
I didn't know you made that kinda money. (subdued) Jeez.
You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?
What? Two animal acts on the same show? (turns to Jerry) What is this, amateur hour? Look, George, I'm sorry, maybe another time, all right? (drums table and exits)
These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't get the shampoo out of my hair.
Right here, come on, I'll show you.. (Gets behind Frank, holding the pool stick with him) Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly..
No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. (Pulls up his sleeve and shows George his arm.) Look.
Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.
Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you.
Yeah, like Diane Fosse. You know she's the only person that's ever been accepted into gorilla society. And you know, once those gorillas accept you, you got it made in the shade.
Eight bucks! I think I got ripped off! (Leaves, yelling out "Newman!")
No no no, well, then who was it?

Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!
Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.
Yeah, you're looking at the new Santa at Coleman's Department store.
Well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
(takes another smell of his hands) Alright I gotta a ten o'clock, I'll see everybody later.
(To Jerry) So how was the big trip?
Yeah, I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred.
Well after that Kidney Stone I only want fresh food. It's gotta be fresh. Im not eating any more stored food. Plus you know I want the space.
Come on Jerry, open up. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!
Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there?
Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe "Bye Bye Birdie" or "My Fair Lady". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.

Jerry, what are you doing? George tells me you're gonna throw your set?
Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.
Put that on the top of your list.
Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say.
