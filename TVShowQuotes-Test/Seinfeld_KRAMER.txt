Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! (Jerry puts on his coat) This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it.
Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be?
(To Jerry) So how was the big trip?
Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished.
Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get him.
Well I thought it was so your parents wouldn't walk in while you're with a girl.
Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?
Man! I never thought you were capable of this!
I don't know, we have a certain chemistry
He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?
And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.
Yeah! Bunsen burner. (runs his fingers through the flame) oo ya ya.
Oh boy, that looks great. I can't believe you're giving him this.
Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.
"Yeah! well ..that's the guy .He's organizing the dinner."
Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe "Bye Bye Birdie" or "My Fair Lady". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.
Alright! Alright. I'm getting off! I'm gonna go on the ramp.
No (throws hand in the air and turns and looks back at Jerry)
(dismayed) So what am I in this for? You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. (is tearing up)
Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.
Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.
You see what happens when you try to be nice?
Oh yea, I like this idea. (sounding very much like Jerry)
Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive. Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it. 8173.
It's a great house, pool, sun deck? Yeah, I'll be there.
Its killing me, I can't eat, I can't sleep. All I can see is that giant red sun in the shape of a chicken. (gets some cereal from the cubard and pours it in a big bowl)
Hey! wait a second. You didn't say hello.
Awright I'm gonna get George to pick me up.
Now are you going to be here in an hour?
(yelling) I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha.
"Well this afternoon I shared a cab with this...a hum..DEENSFREI."
So whadda ya think, Jackie? I mean we got a case?
O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)
Ya' know, people who glitter. She's a slim gal.
Well, this is in case there's a tie!
Mmm-hmm... (turns and walks away, makes a face, raises his eyebrows, nodding his head, then turns back to the group.)
Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video, watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah.
Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.
Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't have the problems we have in the world today. Well, you don't rob somebody, if you know their name!
So Jerry, my millennium party's really coming together. Will people be able to breathe underwater in the year two-thousand?
Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah.
What do I mean?.. Well perhaps he thinks that you're working him for the discount. Shaking that little butt of yours into big, big savings.... And then when you get it,you know, you drop him like a hot potato.
A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll melt your face.
Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there.
I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm never gonna talk again.
Ok, yeah, you guys got to put a negative spin on everything.
Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall grotto?
What do I need to talk for.. ha!, For to blab to the neighbors about George has a new fem-Jerry friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop ho George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend. See now, I've done all that.....Now it's time for silence.
No, I got a girl in the next building
(looks inside the car and gasps) Ohhh Sweet Maria. Hey! lets go.
Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my car-pool lane.
All right I'll be back in a second. You guys coming to my party? (exits)
Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.
So thats the bedroom. Heres the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchenYeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers.
So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off.
Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like it.
Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.
No. I got eight tons of change. I'm loaded.
Hey, you need some roadwork done? 'Cos I met some maintenance guys today on the highway, they could probably help you out.
Okay uh, yeah. I'll have a uh, you have a decaf cappuccino?
Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice.
Yeah. uh..I was in here the other day and I went up to that teller and he didn't say hello.
All right. What if I tell Paul O'Neill to hit a home run tomorrow, just for you.
Oh, come on! What am I gonna do? She's going to eat me alive.
No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's. Yeah.
Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there! (Pauses) All right, next story..
No, an eighteen-wheeler's no good. Too much overhead. You got permits, weigh-stations, tolls... Look, you're way outta your league.
Huh, yeah. (looks round) Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, d'you have any paint thinner? I need like uh, forty gallons.
Whoa. What are you all dressed up for?
Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card.
Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car?
Listen, this is a million dollars we're talkin' about, Jerry, now this is the big league, the big time, now I need you on my team, Jerry!
(ignoring them) Now.. This is the tape that we made earlier and I think, that I see. a couple of buds right here.
So I'd like to give it to you.
I wouldn't have brought it up but since you mentioned it.
I haven't made a bet in three years, I-
You know what woman I always thought you looked like; Leena Horne.
I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too?
(To Rusty) You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence.
(nodding) I'll get the shovel. (walks towards his apartment, as Jerry grimaces at the prospect)
Ahh! Mr. Ross. Mrs. Ross. My name is Cosmo and I'll be your driver for this evening. We have blankets for your comfort. I also have hot chocolate if the mood should strike you.
hey, watch the road! Watch the road, man!
Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!
Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.
(sitting back on the couch) Oh, can you? That's funny, because, as it happens, I don't have call-waiting. Seems to me that the phone company would know that.
Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!
(holding up a set of heavy chains) I'm gonna borrow this, huh?
Well, uh.. (Starts to impersonate Jerry's act) "What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?"
That's right I don't like , I never like her from the get-go.
No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this in. Oh, Jerry look ... Merv Griffin's cigar.
So maybe I'll go down there and watch, uh? She'll be there, ,maybe.
Oh! (turns on the Merv Griffin theme music) Heeeyy! Well, ladies and gentlemen! It's our good friend, George Costanza! What a surprise!
There, you see. She's already in a bad mood. She just got fired.
Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live.
Sure you can. (to Jerry) Such a sweet kid.
(singing) ... It's a big, wild, funky mountain man ...
Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) Hey, you done with that?
Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating, soothing your every aching muscle. The water's gonna get over 120 degrees! (happy)
Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My Osteopath says that it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter. (makes a motion with his hips)
I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh...
The priests theyre helping me. I just bathed in vinegar.
Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce..
That?s fantastic! We'll scalp the tickets, we'll make maybe five hundred a ticket.
Hey, Jerry! Listen, I need you to come downstairs, help me get my stuff outta the car.
What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque.
Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there.
You've selected ... Agent Zero? If that's correct, press one.
(takes one look and sets off after Newman) Jeez!
Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something.
Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, shall we go home?
Okay (lifting the bag and carrying it into the apt.)
Listen uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food. There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa.
(at the door) Well, those aren't for New Year's. Those are my everyday balloons.
You don't pay five cents, you get five cents back. Here, read the label here. (reads from bottle) Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York. Refund, (brings bottle up close to Newman's eyes) vrrup, five cents.
Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?
You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries.
See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?
Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.
By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.
Oh yeah, it's all set. They got the bug boy on him.
Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you're crazy!
(in the shower, on the phone with Jerry) So you broke up?
What would be the point in taking the water?
Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong. People they want to watch freaks. This is a "can't miss."
Armani? Hey, Armani Jerry. (Kramer takes the suit and looks it over)
All right! Yeah.. Courtside.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..
George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the dance. She sends you an enticing photo, you send her one right back.
Hey! Did you hear the bank on the corner is offering a 100 dollars if you go in there and they don't greet you with a hello?
Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J
Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?
what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?
Oh, uh, is this uh, Bette Midler's understudy?
They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment.
(indicating the cereal) Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking on these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box.
He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me.
it's in my book - "Astonishing Tales of the Sea" 51 people died.
Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete.
I'm not joking. She looks like Lyndon Johnson.
Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours.
Yeah, Cupids Rifle -- 830, Sony Lincoln Square. Yeah, no, no, no, no problem, yeah.
See that was nice, Jerry. (under breath) Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.
No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card.
Cars can go on empty, but not us humans, huh, fella? Ill get us a couple of Twix bars.
Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.
Yeah, I know the guy. I take my stuff in there all the time. Yeah, I bet I can get your watch back by tomorrow morning.
It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!
Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.
They are shut. Oh by the way, your friend Seth, he stopped by.
It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.
Well I think I take a normal sip.
Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?
Yeah. This looks right. All right. Give me the dog. Okay, boy. This is it. This is your new home. Let go of my shirt. Come on. Let go of my shirt. This shirt is from Rudy's.
Yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, y'know, old-fashioned useless records, y'know, just... lyin' around--
Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the roof to kill himself.
Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He gets it from his butcher.
Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man.
Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his antics.
Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?
The work piled up, I lost track of time--
Well, lets just say I didnt take him to Peoples Court.
You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you.
Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you believe this Maestro?
Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office..
Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.
From now on, I'll be calling the shots around here...
It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?
Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll. See, keep the big bills on the outside.
So, what do you think about that alien autopsy?
(clapping Jerry on the back) Oh yeah, he's all ready to go.
Well, what, they got any golf courses up there?
(George takes off the hat , he's got that cream on again) Pheeewwww! Boy! You stink.
The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the Super Bowl. So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and *phlf* it's over.
Well, I, uh, I borrowed it last night and it got a little dirty.
Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me, and pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk to them.
What! (Kramer is back to his usual way of speaking)
Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody.
She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out.
So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?
Leapin' Larry's? Hey, that's uptown. You gotta take Amsterdam.
I don't think I can talk to you any more. I feel inferior.
Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah, they got their own case at the end of the aisle.
"Well I take 'em........They give me a Whooooosh."
Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
Ah to take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry ah, what's going on with you? I understand there's a young lady in your life. mmm.
(to George) You , you know what you should've done is watching that report on CNN last night.
Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy American industrialist uh, looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh, before I invest millions in a lucrative mine, I, I'd like to go a little native. Uh, Get the feel of their condiments, of their unmentionables, you know, the real uh, gritty-gritty.
(To Newman) See, we should've gotten some collateral from him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans.
hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm.. .George, George, Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call. and some Sally woman called said "Thanks a lot, she's quitting the business, you ruined her life.
Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, (imitates Gail) "Oh, hi! Kramer!" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.
Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the air.
Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.
"No No I've been living alone a long time now."
Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person.
I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide.
Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be $50,000
Come on Jerry, open up. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!
No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?
All right, get off at the next exit.
Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.
No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet.
Ah, No, no, no, I can't. I learned my lesson from that coffee company.
Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. (Poppie enters.)
I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this.
I here you make a pretty mean calzone.
Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes.
Remember that guy who took my jacket. The one I found at my mother's house.
Oh, hey, listen, by the way - I'm hosting a little get-together tonight in honor of my little financial upturn..
Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.
Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?
Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?
I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow.
Uh, borrow. Its for my friend. Yeah, hell be buying..
(seeing Newman pull up along side him in his truck) Hey.
(singing) ...Johnny ...was a rebel. He rode through the land...
(laughs) Oh hey, you know Elaine, ah she stopped by...
El Paso? I spent a month there one night.
Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked me.
All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.
C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago.
No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight pool.. hmm?
Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, this-this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate!
You talk about your day. How was your day today? Did you have a good day today or a bad day today? Well, what kind of day was it? Well, I don't know. How about you? How was your day?
Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but they all stink!
Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died.
I said how come it's takin' so long?
whoa whoa ginga, you were supposed to tie the knot
ouhhh -- I had Uma Thermans number written on that stub. I lost Umas number.
He'd be perfect for my movie. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. (takes a deep breath) I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a copy of my treatment.
I parked in front of that restaurant . As soon as this race is over I got to go to the airport.
So, uh, what did you want to see me about?
So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, "Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."
"Euh.. Fine , good , yeah! Just been occupying myself with some of your....hem reading material."
Why were you holding the door open for?
Look, George, I can't help ya, all right.
Santa speaks the language of all children. A notchie watchie dotchie do.
No, I didn't make these bagels. (Jerry and George both take a bite) Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. (Jerry and George stop eating) Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test.
(still outside) Helowwwowwow (Estelle opens the door) Hey (kisses Estelle hello) Ha ha, Good evening (George waves)
I think she was happy someone finally said it.
The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.
You don't think I know how you're feeling, every second of the day? Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up from behind. Sitting alone at night, knowing they could be closing in.
All right, here we go, Death Blow. (Brody takes out video camera)
Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan.
(sighs, opens door) Come on in. Did you do this? (Mike has two hand casts on)
So Klompus has the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up. All you gotta do it jiggle it (has is hand out jiggling) jus get it in there (jiggling making a bunch of noises) jigg jigg jiggle reiggle
Hey, wheres your new jacket? (Jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom. Its ruined.) What? (Kramer enters the bathroom, and sees the garment.) Ohhh. What did you do to it?
Is that the waitress from the comedy club?
And...cucumbers! (Grabs a large handful and puts them on the pizza.)
Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for everyone.
No. Alright, watch me now. (Karen sits on the bed. Kramer walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile on his face.) Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? Posture.
If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. I'm not Kramer.
No, no, these are too thick. (removes the gloves/tosses them on the kitchen counter)
(pleading) Elaine, you can't go to Newman's Newmanniun.
Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year. (signing as he speaks) So I haven't been able to do it in a while.
My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold. (Frantic) I can't get into a zone!
Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call.
You see kid, you're being bamboozaled. These capatalist fat cats are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys.
He spit on us.... and I screamed out, "I'm hit!"
(Holding camera) Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen door. (Takes picture) Perfect.
Well we're talking with Elaine Benes; Adult film star on the set of her new picture "Elaine does the Upper West side"
A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell it privately.
Jerry, you're not in show business. You don't know what these people are like.
I said she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
All right, look. I'm going to be honest. I'm very interested in the van.
Y-ea (pours a few more Junior Mints into his hand and eats them)
"Well, because we hit it off and he was very impressed with what I do."
Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other at our word, all is lost.
(Takes it off the hook, and starts walking toward Jerry with it. He backs defensively backs away from it) Well, she asked you.
Alright! Yeah. You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry. In a way, I feel like I'm getting a new couch.
Aw, okay. (picks up the phone and starts dialling) Yeah, I need his shoeshine kit. (still dialling) He always hides it from me. (puts the phone to his ear and waits for a second or two) Yeah, Bally's? Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld's room, please.
Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible.
Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. They're delicious.
(running to the window) What?! Not my car!! Hey!! They're towing my car!!
Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage disposal?
Well, I'm sorry. Well, George, I tried to put the good word in for you with Siena, but I don't think she heard me. You know, left ear?
Ooo she likes you buddy (they to a high five hand shake)
T.C.B. You know, takin' care o' business. Aa--I gotta go.
Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must walk among them.
Eight hours of jingle belling and ho ho hoing. Boy, I am ho'd out.
Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby got promoted!
CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach.
No Jerry! I - I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken. Now you leave those roasters alone. Kenny never hurt anybody.
Thats for me. (to the phone) Kramerica Industries. Oh, hi, Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie...
And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.
That's it George. Come on, come on. Give it to me. Come on,work it. Work it. Yeah be a man, be a man.
Ya know I hate to brag but, uh, I did win eleven straight golden gloves.
No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.
I *love* the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette!
Alright, Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change.
These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.
...and uh, I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem. Well, the point is, doctor uh, I'm very much in love with Elaine...
That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster.
One day, youll beg me to make your own pie.
Oh yeah. Exercises every muscle in the body. It's great for the back.
No no, I don't like this one. It's too yellow. Any pickles?
Good, good. Lets uh keep it that way.
I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.
(explaining) Oh yeah, I put all your zees on the weights and measures page.
I'll let her down easy. All right. (he gets up and walks to Olive) Well, hi Olive. (she reaches for Kramer's back) No, no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you.
Hey. (to Elaine) Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV.
It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...
Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know anybody who can help me cook?
(enters apartment, holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! (inserts tape into VCR, sets up TV)
All right, so we let the girls decide.
