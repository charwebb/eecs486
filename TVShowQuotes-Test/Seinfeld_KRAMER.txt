I like to stop at the duty free shop!
Youre his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesnt even know?
All right look, I am going to have to pay you back later. I don't have my wallet.
Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing.
Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.
Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal.
Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table.
That looked like milk to me! Jerry my Rods and Cones are all screwed up! Alright, that's it.  I gotta move in with you Jerry.
Wait, wai, ... ... Yeah. Hello!, Hi, Aw, this is Kramer. Yeah, I'm the next door neighbor. Aw, well you know, ah Jerry's left, uh, uh, But listen, ah, see ah, my golf game got canceled. Uh, I'm thinkin' of going up myself... They got pies and ah, I got the directions right here.
I wouldn't have brought it up but since you mentioned it.
Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking.
All right, so we let the girls decide.
Oh Come on Jerry, It's all the way over to twelfth avenue..
Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together.
Yeah, you should. I certainly remember you. Let me refresh your memory.
(interrupts) No, notime! Its all this meaningless time. Laundry, grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any idea how much time I waste in this apartment?
Look, I'm not judging you. In fact, we here at PBS, we have many programs celebrating your lifestyle. Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City, Gender Bending and Swinging in San Francisco. Before Stonewall about those dark ages when you couldn't come out of the closet, lest you be persecuted because of your, you know.
I told you, he thinks you're a phony.
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!
Yeah, but before I met up with her, I stopped to look at the monkeys, when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel. I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I *whap* let him have it.
You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in your head.
So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega.
Right now there six-hundred Titleists that I got from the driving range in the trunk of my car. Why don't we drive out to Rock-a-Way and hit `em-----------(very over excited) into the ocean! Now picture this.... we find a nice sweet spot between the dunes, we take out our drivers, we tee up and (he makes a golf stroke), that ball goes sailing up into the sky holds there for a moment and then....... ..... gulp!
(to Joel) Its gonna be hot in a minute.
For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you.
(To Jerry) No, I don't want it back.
Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in a epic struggle for world domination. It's winner take all. People cannot be trusted.
(nervous) I gotta find Elaine. Y'know, she's gonna pull my plug.
Yeah, and I'm playing a business man accused of murder.
Ohh, He's got a big sweat going. (Takes an envelope out of his pocket.) Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents.
(quickly) Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.
Four hours in this chop and I'm a full inch taller. . . . Giddyup.
Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.
That's Michigan. In Michigan you get ten cents.
Alright, you know what this is gonna do? He's gonna be upset because you didn't call him and we're not gonna get those tickets for Friday night.
You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah.
I'm sorry. I mean, I know what it's like to be in love. Ties you up in knots. And Jerry is a very sexy man.
Okay, look, uh, when you're in Florida, can my cigar guy drop off some Cubans for me at your parents' house?
Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer.
(To George) Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get my thoughts together.
(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
Sand, I can get rid of the sand. (he sits at the table, looking down his shirt) Look theres still some in here, it won't go away! Look I even got sand in the pockets!
It's the only way you'll learn. (Tastes his eggs.) Aw, these eggs are disgusting. This chicken should be ashamed of himself.
Yeah, I'll talk to Jerry. Yeah, [Hangs up] . . . you know that was Michael and Carol. She's wondering when we're going to come over and see the baby.
I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible! I'm gonna hit the tanning machines.
Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.
Yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) See? It should sound like that, something like that.
(Looking over Mickey's shoulder at the script) Yeah, well, I was a different man then.
Look at you! You've got another gig! Uhh.
Ah, the steering wheel fell off. I don't know where it is.
Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.
Eleven, corner pocket. (Pulls back on his stick, accidentally crashing it into the window)
(laughing to himself) Somehow I dozed off and woke up in a pile of garbage.
Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?
Well you're not exactly zeroing in yourself, lady.
(notices the painting) Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen!
What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque.
The way I figure it I've already been there and I plan on rounding second tonight at around eleven o'clock.
He's pulling out a gun! He's got a gun, Jerry!!
Say you're getting intimate with a woman uh, you don't want her fumbling and struggling back there.
No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?
Ohh kay! Well, you know, I had Bob Saccamano on the phone, and I suddenly realized that I- (Elaine stops him)
Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me.
Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy.
Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running into the park.
Well Bob Sacamano he stayed with me once for a year and a half.
All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your bed.
My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit!
Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!
No Jerry! I - I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken. Now you leave those roasters alone. Kenny never hurt anybody.
Well I could put a, dresser in there. I could get dressed while Im making breakfast.
If a guy saved your life you'd be in love with him too.
Yea we worked it out all over dinner last night.
Well Lomez, he usually runs it but he's in the Everglades.
Well whats the difference -- Come on (pats him on the back) -- were like Cain and Able.
Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?
(looking around) Look at this building. What is this?
Well, there really is no junk-mail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card, but...
(opening the door) Alright. I'll get that money for you in five minutes. And, don't eat any more.
Here you go brother. Some food for you.
Oh. Well, would you look at that. (puts a gun-shaped hand to his head and goes 'Pop') I guess I forgot to lock it.
(Still laughing) That's true.. (Gets up) I'll be right back. (Walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low-talker. A moment passes)
I *love* the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette!
Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with. (sniffing wall) Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?
I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else.
Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories.
(entering the condo, and going to the fridge as if he's a neighbor) Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?
Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest.
Well, we talked about a lot of things.
Well its a Bordeaux. Robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais -- which is richer and fruitier. Ahh, here's one. Twelve dollars.
Alright, put a little sauce on here... (speaks some unintelligible words in an Italian accent while spreading the sauce around.) Some cheese...
(Kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love. (Jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs it as he listens to Kramer) Every muscles she touches just... (long pause) ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy. (Jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch)
What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie?
He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been doing that for years, right Jerry?
Man! I never thought you were capable of this!
(to the phone) Look, I'll call you back. (hangs up)
Im completely changing the configuration of the apartment. Youre not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.
It's not for me. It's for Hilde -- the waitress I was telling you about. She's hungry, she wants food. If I go back in there without any food ... there's gonna be trouble. (his voice gets really high pitched on his last sentence)
(removing his coat) Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex Theatre.
Mine was better than that! Come on look. (starts to laugh again, Jerry too)
Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now. (he rushes back into the theater)
What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?
(singing) Johnny Yuma was a rebel, Yeah! ...
You're gonna score some big points with the man upstairs on this one.
How do you know he's not wondering the same thing about you?
George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean.
Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs.
Why don't you just tell me the name of the movie you've selected.
All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal and I'll take your picture.
Alright I'll uh, I'll call her at home. (To man waiting behind him) Go ahead, it's all yours.
You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor)
(light admonishing, under breath) Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..
Yeah. (Lies on the couch and cracks the back of his head against the armrest.) Hey, what's with your ceiling? (Mom and Pop look up.)
Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children?
Wait a minute, I think he's done. (peers at the Saab) Oh no, he's taking out the woods!
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. ((takes a swig and reacts))
George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on.
No no, I found the place, I set the whole thing up, I'm doing all the leg work.
I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything else, Mr. Nosy?
Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; First with that girl whose life you destroyed and.. emm...about George dating a lady Jerry
(Continuing as if nothing happened) Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body.
Yeah... So c'mon, (smacks hands and rubs them together) what d'you say?
If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.
Man, I'm going to be hitting the links all weekend. Ffoooo (Taking an imaginary swing, he makes the sound of a golf ball being hit)
(to car as it accelerates away) Hey pig!
How does it look on your side? [Pause while George just stares at him] We'll get there...
Mmm (smelling the lotion as he rubs it in) I'm gonna remember that if I'm ever in Florida.
Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in America.
Well, what're you gonna do with all that money?
No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?
I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.
Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.
We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper with it.
(once again, overly excited) Now are you just sayin' you want to have fun or do you reallllly want to have fun?!
Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but the next think I knew..
Well who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint-- it's *delicious*!
Oh yeah, yeah, great. (calling after the guy) And get some of those blue corn chips.
But what am I gonna do for fruit?
Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take care of everything.
Huh-yah! (Kramer loses it and runs out past George, who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.)
Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.
Oh, you just bring it in sideways and (pop) hook it.
You know, for phone numbers, addresses, keep appointments, everything.
Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus.
...so I said to him Arthur, Artie come on, why does the salesman have to die? Change the title; The life of a salesman. That's what people want to see.
(walking into Jerry's apartment with a fresh black eye) You got a steak?
Just be yourselves. ( Elaine plays with her hair flirtingly)
Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy. (he half-coughs, half-retches) I gotta get, some air.
Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet.
Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his antics.
Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other hand he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?
Yeah, here we go, yeah. (he takes a big bite) Mmm, oh. That's delicious. Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat. (he takes another bite)
No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry.
(filling a pipe) Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything?
Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.
(nervous) Okay, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans.
Oh, well I guess she found some place better to go.
There's nothing more pathetic, than a grown man, whos afraid of a woman . (voice get high-pitched for the last line)
...and uh, she's very much in love with me, and uh, well uh, we would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist, and allow us to pursue our courtship unfettered.
Jerry , this is a miracle of nature that exists for a brief period. It's like the Aurora Borealis.
You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.
You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table.
Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So, how did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.
So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?
Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the "old" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it.
Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. He won't like that.
Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and then Jerry, tipped him off.
Hey, Jerry, he could have used your laugh. He was a big turkey out there.
You know, I never thought of it like that before, doctor. (points) You, are absolutely right.
Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience.
Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you.
We've officially bottomed out, mm. Who's our next guest?
Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap.
The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two, fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time.
No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life.
Ah, (smacks hands) there you are. My date stood me up. Listen, will you guys go to the operation with me?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, where did you take it?
Ok, can I just talk to somebody? Can I just explain...
Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the roof to kill himself.
Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.
it's in my book - "Astonishing Tales of the Sea" 51 people died.
(inspecting Jerry's van) So, how come you're selling it?
I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the Soup Nazi.
That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN.
Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, that was a Shemp, right?
No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?
(Watching Rusty's pulling of the rickshaw) Giddy up! Good form.
It's Marion's poetry. I can't take it (leaves sobbing)
Well open the door, you get a better look.
Jerry, I left you a pair right here...(goes into Jerry's room and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.) C'mon. There, put on those boots.
They're from the lost and found at the Alex.
Why would you think I would invite him?
(pronouncing it "kar-ah-tay") Karate, Jerry. Karate. The lifetime pursuit of balance and harmony.
I'll tell you when it's enough! (he releases George) Alright, now you better not say anything, or I'll stalk you!
It's about this woman, in a coma. Well, I couldn't finish watching it, so I want you to read this.
(quietly) Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.
Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman. (Starts coughing again)
Yeah. (putting hand to his mouth, hatching a thought)
Alright, alright. Fine George! Don't chip in! But some day, we're gonna be driving along, we're gonna look out the window, and see her crawling along 5th avenue! Is that what you want?
Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?
Jerry, I dont think this thing is hooked up right.
I got three 'Pottery Barn' catalogs in one day. That makes eight this month.
I, uh, need to speak to you about some lady problems.
It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.
Yeah, my mind's a blank, I'm sorta nervous, you know, uh...
Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival, the sites, sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm
Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's...
Listen, this is a million dollars we're talkin' about, Jerry, now this is the big league, the big time, now I need you on my team, Jerry!
"Yeah! yeah! right after I left the Y."
Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer hands out the hot dogs)What a great day!
Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.
The work piled up, I lost track of time--
I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen.
No, come on. (Larry the cook comes over)
Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.
Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee.
Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership, and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone says, "Kramer and that other guy, oh, they went further to the left of the slash than anyone ever dreamed!"
I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating.
Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt.
Look, Java World. (To cabbie) Hey listen I'm gonna get out here. I'm gonna get myself a free cafe latte.
So, uh... what are you gonna do with that one now?
Boy, its too bad you gave me this one too.
Jerry, you gotta give him some credit. (starts rubbing a stick of Jerry's butter across his face) You're just being totally ridiculous. (keeps rubbing) I'll see you later buddy.
Hey! Who do you think you're talking to.
I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head?
Yeah, well you're gonna have to cancel it, because I've told everybody about my party.
Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, this-this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate!
Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we?
Hey. That's a big oven. Huh. Listen. I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
Yeah but what if I am? I'm the last... male Kramer! We're facing extinction!
It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Git gt gt.
I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because I have no Tupperware.
Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market.
You know that, uh, Leslie (Points to her) is in the clothing business? She's a designer.
Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?
Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything. (Sensing Steve's disappointment) Well, but I might have something.
(Looking at Jerry's doodle) That's a nice triangle...
Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free.
I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.
Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood. Everything I have I owe to this face.
Well, the camp ended a few days early.
This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last.
Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. (points to plate) Proctology.
"Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together."
Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you!
No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em all up, and you give me the bill.
(screaming) YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD! (hysterically) Fight for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you!
Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.
Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat and giggley.
...F, E, L, D. (half-laughing) Well, I think you're wrong. (listens) Alright, you have a lucky day, too.
Alright, you know I'm supposed to go on this special tour today with George's girlfriend.
Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants.
Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh. (notices the Urban Sombrero) What is that?
Featuring the mind-blowing performance of Ms. Raquel Welch!
Because nobody does it like she does. She's the best.
Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.
Wooo, you know what you just did? You let a burglar in the building.
(holds up some small white sachets) I took these out of every single garment in the store.
Well its, uh, well its too hard to keep up, you know, they were tired.
Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.
I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.
Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.
Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy.
(sitting back on the couch) Oh, can you? That's funny, because, as it happens, I don't have call-waiting. Seems to me that the phone company would know that.
All right, [claps hands] I'm gonna go get some soup.
Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.
I used to have a problem. (into phone) Well, what d'you mean, he's not registered? Wha..S, E, I, N, V...
Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you're crazy!
"He..he... When they pull that needle out I let the expletives fly."
Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it.
Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball.
Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough for you, buddy. And you too, Elaine, I haven't forgotten you.
Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, in Russian, the cable guy, they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition. (Turns back to the woman) Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple?
You gotta play him like me. I'm Kramer.
Nothing doing. Jerry, I didn't do anything. It's the monkey that should be apologizing to me.
Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He let me put it in his meat freezer.
Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.
You know, I cant believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you couldve invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.
Oh, well, no rush. (wipes his nose) Uh oh.
Well there is the possibility that you've gone right out of your mind.
Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the Village, then you're gonna see a magic show.
You stop it man.. you're FREAKING ME OUT!!!
Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's movin' away.
Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry?... Reeeally one for the books!
Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to sleep in a really hot room?
Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up there.
Well what happens if I can't play like I was? What about the tour, and all my dreams?
You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.
(Speaking very fast and fidgety) You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes, it says so right here. And I don't want to get dirty looks when I come in here. If I want a cafe latte, you give me a cafe latte. And if I have any problems I'm gonna get my lawyer Jackie Chiles down here and your gonna be in really big trouble.
Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera. The Bold And The Beautiful.
(putting on jacket) Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV. You take Mannix for example.
Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gould is sitting on you and the next thing - you're yesterday's trash.
Oh, there's action. There's plenty of action. That damned alien autopsy is stealing all the headlines.
You know what I mean - pork, sausage, (A LA PORKY PIG) A-deek-a-deek-a- deek th-th-th-that's all folks.
Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?
Uh, borrow. Its for my friend. Yeah, hell be buying..
no no no, I don't think so. You love him
Jerry, its not for people, its for oil tankers.
Ooh. Well, this is uh, risky business, huh? I'm all a-twitter.
YOU SAID YES!? Don't you have any pride or self respect? I mean, how can you prostitute yourself like this? I mean what are you going to do? You're going to start driving him to the airport?
You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.
Darren is going away for a long long time.
Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'll be right back.
All right, here we go, Death Blow. (Brody takes out video camera)
You don't think I know how you're feeling, every second of the day? Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up from behind. Sitting alone at night, knowing they could be closing in.
Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?
Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.
(screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!
(looking at a map) I don't know. (over the speaker) Uh, no more questions.
Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop.
Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should settle this.
I left a Macanaw peach in your refrigerator.
Elaine, you should be there to document it.
Hey, what do you think they'll do to us?
The add said that the bank's gonna pay a hundred dollars if you are not greeted with a hello
(Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue)
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I need my massages! Can't you see I'm burned out!
I don't think I can talk to you any more. I feel inferior.
Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.
This is a good cigar (hair is on fire, white smoke pouring from the back of his head) . . . . . . WOOOOOOOOOOW . . . (runs to bathroom, his arms in the air -- he bangs them in to the top of the hallway door jam and falls into the bathroom)
You know, you should call this off, Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual.
Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this.
So then I drive all the way up to the country club and then I find out they got a tournament goin' on. Do you mind if I smoke?
It was outrageous. And she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
They're prisons. Man made prisons. You're doing time. You get up in the morning. She's there. You go to sleep at night. She's there. It's like you gotta ask permission to use the bathroom. Is it all right if I use the bathroom now?
Yeah, well I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight lasted two seconds.
(from his apartment) Hey, Jerry! Come here a sec!
