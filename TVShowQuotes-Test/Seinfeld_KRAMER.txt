Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?
You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.
I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind.
Well whats the difference -- Come on (pats him on the back) -- were like Cain and Able.
(on phone) A turkey sandwich. A side of slaw,  you want whit e meat or dark?
(shouting) Jerry! We've lost the fat man, and we're running lean. We're back on track, buddy!
I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm waiting for my new heat pump.
Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your beef?
Hey, George! (Holds out his hand. George shakes it - a hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs)
Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.
Alright I'll uh, I'll call her at home. (To man waiting behind him) Go ahead, it's all yours.
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. ((takes a swig and reacts))
Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass frames?
Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart.
You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.
Oh, yeah. (snaps fingers) You know, I forgot my wallet.
Why don't you just tell me the name of the movie you've selected.
Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry.
I told you! Now, Frank, listen. Here's what I'm thinking. Now, you have a friend in the bra business, right?
Hey, you need some roadwork done? 'Cos I met some maintenance guys today on the highway, they could probably help you out.
You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock in the morning there
Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas
Yeah.. (Sizes up his next shot. His stick jams into the window as he draws back) See? This is no good.. (Looks around the room. His sights fall on the Maestro's baton) Hey, the baton. (Chalks it up) I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss. (Measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (Does just that) Giddy-up. (Moves around to the other side of the board, judging his next move) Six in the corner. (Hits it in) This table's mine. (A series of Kramer's plays are displayed, and, on the last ball of the game..) You know where it's going..
Well, I'm Cosmo Kramer, I'm one of the producers.
Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's one of the things that we argue about.
From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you don't know me.
Leapin' Larry's? Hey, that's uptown. You gotta take Amsterdam.
I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.
No , no no no no. Weddings are a great place to meet chicks. I have to be unfettered.
Oh, well I guess she found some place better to go.
Well Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue, you don't want to skip on the, swank.
Clark Bar. (Kramer starts tearing the candy wrapper open with his teeth.)
You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. "Hey, denty!" Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools.
Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.
But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh.
Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...
No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.
(impressed) Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.
Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line.
Hey, I dont care. Im just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock, now!
Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.
Hey Bania, what's happening? (Kramer, looking into the mirror, is putting moisturizer under his eyes)
Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his antics.
Look at you! You've got another gig! Uhh.
You know, in the year two-thousand, we'll all be on speed-dial. You'll just have to think of a person, they'll be talking to you. It'll be like, wup (judders and puts his hands to his temples, as if receiving a call on a 'mental phone') getting a call here.
Hey, Are you going to the hospital now?
Probably. Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.
He spit on us.... and I screamed out, "I'm hit!"
Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa!
Hey What are you doing in my car? Hey!Hey!Hey! Where you going.
All right. Lay them on me. I'll take three.
Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy.
Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered... (opens door to leave, still very happy, then) Feel like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!! (exits)
Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable texture. You'd never know it was non-fat.
(offended) 'Literally'? What's THAT supposed to mean? (then to Jerry, before Elaine can answer) You mind if I hide this somewhere?
Uh, see here, I.. (Pulls out a paper ring from his pocket) I saved one of the cigar rings..
I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.
Do? Do? Hey, I'm doing what I do. You know, I've always done what I do. I'm doing what I do, way I've always done and the way I'll always do it.
I just can't get over how fantastic you look.
Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a (Snaps his fingers in rhythm with his words) lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog (Stops snapping) - all on the same day.
(Leaving) George, you listen to me. I owe ya one.
In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in men's fashion.. It's a, a puffy shirt. (Leslie mumbles to Kramer) Well, yeah, it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.
(Up to something) Well, its a test drive, right? I never drive around here. If Im gonna recommend this car, I need to see that itll handle my daily routine.
(Smiling) You bet we are! Huh, Smuckers? (Smuckers coughs. They turn to leave) I'll see ya.
Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I *still* got time to catch him!
(Looks at the bags on the floor) Evidently.
(acting very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. (pause, stops acting) Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?
As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a freeloader.
Roger's can't sell chicken around here, we got chicken places on every block.
Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself together.
What would be the point in taking the water?
(shouting) Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees!
Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight! (Voight waves at Kramer and hurriedly gets in the cab. Kramer runs over to the car.) Hey, listen, can I ask you something? Listen, listen...(Leans in the the open back window of the cab. Defensively, Voight grabs Kramer's arm and bites it. Kramer screams. The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street, stunned.)
The last couple a days hes been acting very strange. I think hes avoiding me.
Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies.
I got it. Uma, Uma, Uma. (looking at the ticket)
No. No. No. Its for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact.
look come on, let me use it, 5 minutes, I'll pay you back huh?
Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright.
Say you're getting intimate with a woman uh, you don't want her fumbling and struggling back there.
(Off-screen) No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and I didn't make it.
You gotta come through with the hips first.
Oh! God, It's a Pig man! A pig man!
So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega.
(emerging from the changing room) Well, I don't mind if I do.
You talk about your day. How was your day today? Did you have a good day today or a bad day today? Well, what kind of day was it? Well, I don't know. How about you? How was your day?
Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.
I dont know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I havent been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. Im clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right?
See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?
All right now here's the list. (hands Jerry the list)
iIs it? Or is it so possible your heard is spinning like a top?
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I need my massages! Can't you see I'm burned out!
Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must walk among them.
What, at this place? It would destroy my whole profit margin.
It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!
Yeah. Well I was trying to make gravel and it just (moves hands around) just didnt work out.
All right, I've had it with you two. (opens apartment door to leave)
(pointing to the largest one) Now, what is this?
You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream.
Het, Mickey when do we get a break? My lap is killing me.
Ju - Excuse me. Yeah we're, talking this way.
Alright we gotta get back to the show. What are you guys doing?
Well, you got wires sticking out every which way. That looks dangerous, you should call the electrician.
No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you.
Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world!
Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine... (pats her on the shoulder twice.)
Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating, soothing your every aching muscle. The water's gonna get over 120 degrees! (happy)
Look, I know what I?m doing here George.
Wait, wai, ... ... Yeah. Hello!, Hi, Aw, this is Kramer. Yeah, I'm the next door neighbor. Aw, well you know, ah Jerry's left, uh, uh, But listen, ah, see ah, my golf game got canceled. Uh, I'm thinkin' of going up myself... They got pies and ah, I got the directions right here.
Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!
All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?
I know what this is about Father. I didnt do anything. I just spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. Its just that, that I have this power.
How often do you cut your toe nails?
You know I never got a library card.
Come on, Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit?
That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!
(Judging up his next move) As soon as the game is over..
(Holding camera) Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen door. (Takes picture) Perfect.
Oh, what? Am I... tooo boring for you?
Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car?
Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon.
(To Jerry) So how was the big trip?
I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is?
Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough for you, buddy. And you too, Elaine, I haven't forgotten you.
She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.
You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.
Hey. Hey Elaine, what do you say if neither of us is married in ten years, we get hitched?
Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!
Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had an
Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked me.
Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m.
Well ..I don't argue with the body Jerry. It's an argument you can't win.
Hey, I'm going to be right back. I'm going to get a match.
Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?
Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong!
Yeah, hey listen, I can't. It's gonna be taking us out of our way.
There's nothing more pathetic, than a grown man, whos afraid of a woman . (voice get high-pitched for the last line)
You see kid, you're being bamboozaled. These capatalist fat cats are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys.
Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.
Hey, Jerry! Listen, I need you to come downstairs, help me get my stuff outta the car.
How do you know he's not wondering the same thing about you?
If a guy saved your life you'd be in love with him too.
Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. (points to plate) Proctology.
Yeah. (Lies on the couch and cracks the back of his head against the armrest.) Hey, what's with your ceiling? (Mom and Pop look up.)
So Jackie, do you think we gotta case?
Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya.
Oh yeah, it's working out. And I got a date with that waitress who works at Reggies.
Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.
Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied, his every move. For example, he dunks.
"Well he said that humm.. you know.that it helps his pathients relax a little bit..and he's got a new polithy Adults only."
It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.
...They'll saw through bone. Uuuuuuuing yutyutyutyutn naannnaaa [makes saw noises while gesturing over Roy's chest] You'll see what's *inside* bone...
Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring.
Oh yeah. Home-made pies, two hundred yards back.
Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?
(relaxing) ...oooohhh yeeaaah... aaahhh... (he is really enjoying this)
(grabs briefcase to leave) I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. (leaves)
Well, let's see speeding, running a red light, no license, no registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah. (gives George a ticket)
(sighs, opens door) Come on in. Did you do this? (Mike has two hand casts on)
Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?
Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works over at the police station. He's a composite artist.
All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? (starts playback)
I haven't made a bet in three years, I-
Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!
I'd look again. So ah, how come you didn't call Jerry about all this?
George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send him to another doctor?
Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.
Nothing, I'm gonna finish watching The Other Side Of Darkness.
Well, why dont you take your clothes off?
Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing.
Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there.
Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to tell.
Your boss. Didn't you tell him about the coffee table book?
No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this in. Oh, Jerry look ... Merv Griffin's cigar.
Common Jerry, this guy is crazy. Get out.
Well I could put a, dresser in there. I could get dressed while Im making breakfast.
Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.
The way I remember it, Cain, he was a successful doctor, but when he took this special formula, he became Mr. Able.
You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away.
It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich.
[In Newman's ear] This guy's nothin' but a piece of crap...
Well, I'm gonna go to the cigar stores. I'm gonna see if I can sell that Indian.
Yeah, yeah go ahead yeah, put the banner up doesn't matter to me.
That's right I don't like , I never like her from the get-go.
Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.
Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera. The Bold And The Beautiful.
Jerry, I left you a pair right here...(goes into Jerry's room and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.) C'mon. There, put on those boots.
Man! I never thought you were capable of this!
Pisano's. That's the place by the stadium right?
(holds up framed picture) There she blows! (throws paper around)
Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate other women, and they hate you.
Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're gonna cut him open -- His guts'll be all over the place...
Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. (points to bucket)
I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.
(clapping Jerry on the back) Oh yeah, he's all ready to go.
No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have introduced him.
No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.
Oh. (continuing to itch and scratch from the sand)
No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt. He took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it.
I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) It would be nice if you got him something. (Punches the the table to accentuate this, and leaves.)
Oh, you didn't notice? It has a pee-stain.
Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.
Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here?
Henry... can I get out of here now?
Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard ... and when you throw it - Pop! Oh look, (FDR is at the cash register, pays and leaves Monks) there's my friend, FDR. I'm gonna nail him in the back of the head. It's gonna be great! (Rushes out of Monks to peg his friend with the snowball)
I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy.
Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here?
I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.
Hey look, if you're going there, maybe you could pick me up some of this super hydrating, it's a total-protection moisturizer with Uva.
(fearful) There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes.
Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run the bases.
Hi, here. I made this for your. (gives her a pasta statue)
Listen, I need you to do me a favor.
Now that's a great looking shirt! (Gets up, admiring the shirt) Aye Captain! (Growls like a pirate) Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect. (Walks around Jerry, inspecting the shirt) Look at it! It's fantastic!
Yeah, well, I could do it. I dont wanna do it.
I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?
You mind if I use it in my book?
(to the Chinese delivery boy) How much do I owe you?
Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there.
No, I want to speak to the manager.
Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet.
Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt.
(examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff? No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.
Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. (pulls out his pocket-watch (it has a chain, too)) I am springin' ahead riiight now.
Yeah, here we go, yeah. (he takes a big bite) Mmm, oh. That's delicious. Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat. (he takes another bite)
Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?
Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today! (The phone rings.)
I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up.
(very quickly) oh I don't think so, no we never met, I never talked to you before on the phone, alright I'll see you later buddy
I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.
Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge.
Check it out. (They see a Marlboro man billboard with Kramer on it)
(Taking his pair off, he inspects them) Aw, beautiful!
Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?
...and uh, she's very much in love with me, and uh, well uh, we would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist, and allow us to pursue our courtship unfettered.
Whooooa! here's the director Jerry Seinfeld . Jerry , you discovered Elaine Benes?
Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something.
So I listened to my katra and now <vreep> I'm dominating the dojo. I'm class champion.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Cosmo Kramer. Yeah, I had an appointment to annul my living will.
Well, I ah, gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?
Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?
I don't know. But now they got a chart on me.
Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.
Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch, he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him.
Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.
Alright, alright, fine. You take the monkey's side, alright, go ahead.
Well, is it alright if I try it?
Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.
No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman I know!
(interrupting) Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no. Nobody wears it like that.
Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go check it out.
W..W..Wa...Wa..Wait..Wait wait.. Now lets videotape your head for the before picture, so we can watch how it grows and stuff. Sit down (George sits).....Lean back...A little bit to the right.
Yeah, the little father has run his hard out. They're gonna break his maiden.
Oh yea, I like this idea. (sounding very much like Jerry)
C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.
I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?
Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board.
Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me, but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind.
This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.
You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table.
Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?
Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area.
You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower.
Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?
(cont'd) so that he was gonna take me into his confidence.
I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.
Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
hey, watch the road! Watch the road, man!
Its killing me, I can't eat, I can't sleep. All I can see is that giant red sun in the shape of a chicken. (gets some cereal from the cubard and pours it in a big bowl)
It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Git gt gt.
Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter.
Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! (Kramer turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.)
They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!
So maybe I'll go down there and watch, uh? She'll be there, ,maybe.
I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible! I'm gonna hit the tanning machines.
No. You can't let him get away with this.
Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in.
Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice.
(high pitched voice) "Well women do it." I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you can just (high pitched voice) sashey your pretty little self around the town square.
So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of emotions.
Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span.
I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume.
C'mon here, try 'em on. (Jerry sits down and puts the boots on.)
Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.
Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail!
No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerry's gunned down by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry, cupping Jerry's head in his hands) Cable boy, cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?..
Here you go, here you go, check it out.
You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.
O.K., listen, I want you to come by later, alright? 'Cause we're having a victory party for Little Jerry.
All right Come on....again attempts to pull headphones off)
Thank - you! (Gets his coat, and leaves)
Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?
Hey!! Buddy. I thought of a great invention for driving. A periscope in a car, so you can see the traffic.
I can't get my pants off, and Mickey's audition is in twenty minutes! You know, I'm supposed to be a business man, I gotta be in costume!
(picks up paper) Chunnel , is playing at the Paragon 84th Street cinema in the main theater at 930 PM.
Newman. (On the other side of the bookcase, Newman preens proudly.)
Oh, yeah, yeah. I was a little off last week, huh Jerry -- Yeah but the doctor says it was just a slight concussion
I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I can make things very unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one.
Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.
No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to get back at me.
Yeah. (beat) And, it was a big one.
Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we don't play at all.
No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? I mean, it was edgy, it was not my sort of thing but some of those people out there, they really liked it.
Well my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself miles and miles of open lanes.
Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like it.
She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus?
Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?
No no you didn't ...Hundred dollars.. I get a hundred dollars.
Well, I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt.
Shees, come on...(opens the radiator)..this thing is bone dry. (Looks at the blood.)
Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. A long while.
Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.
Eight hours of jingle belling and ho ho hoing. Boy, I am ho'd out.
Listen, we went in on a CD together.
Did I tell you Im getting a new telephone number?
I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too?
Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with. (sniffing wall) Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?
Oh. Oh man. (Takes out a Kleenex and puts his head back. Jon Voight comes out of a doorway and hails a cab.)
No, but this is all very exciting. (sounding very much like jerry)
Heyyyy! (bangs the table in frustration and grabs the key)
Oh yeah yeah yeah. Orthodox, Jerry. Old school.
The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.
So I'd like to give it to you.
The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces together) Yeah.
