Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schrute���
Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy?
I may have heard from an old client, and I may have immediately started spreading the news to other clients and potential clients, yeah. But I'm not here to talk about that. I am here to talk about Suck It. Suck it.
Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work.
Well, finish up. I'm gonna meet with Val about that warehouse guy you had to let go and you and I will talk in 15 minutes?
We had to pay for it.  Cost us thirty five hundred dollars.
Well, I'm just glad to know you're happy because you know I felt bad.
Okay.
No, no, no, no, no. This was rough. We never meant for you to get caught in the middle of this. I'm very sorry.
You sure?
