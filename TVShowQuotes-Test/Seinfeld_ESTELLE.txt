George?
George, where are you going?!
(with her arms out in wonder) What did we ever do to them? (George puts his arms out and imitates Estelle as she moves her arms up and down as she speaks) I want to know what we did them!

Oh, I was so worried. (grabs a couple of tissues from the box)

Where am I going to sleep?
(Apologizing) I'll try to be more careful.

What's the matter with your arm?
Uh, Bakersoll.
Be quiet. They're starting the press conference.
Well, come on!
I want you to go see a psychiatrist.
