You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.
Your father's right. It's beautiful.
(Heavy in sarcasm) Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star!
George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you!
Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?
(From other room) It's junk.
She's not Chinese; I was duped!!
Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy.
You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich..
(to Frank) I told you not to give it to him!
Oh, really?
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! (goes into another room)
Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's a real trouble maker!
Here's your omelet.
So, Georgie, we have some big news for you.
Oh, hello Elaine!
(Meek) But Georgie.. what about the Jell-O?
Long Island?!?! I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!
I think they are made from lycra-spandex.
Oh, my God!
Georgie, I'm a divorcee.
Where am I going to sleep?
I like tap dancing.
I always talk about your hands - how they're so soft and milky white..
(answers the door) Lloyd?
The NBC guy liked it?
(not really noticing Jerry said Hello) Hello, Kramer. Close the door.
Oh, I can't help it!
