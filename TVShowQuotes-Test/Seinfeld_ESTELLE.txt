I know, we were looking at the brochure.
Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here!
So, Georgie, we have some big news for you.

I think you're all a little touched in the head. (Puts the plate down) You're so worried about your health.. You're young men.
Don't give me "Ma". It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open.
It's that temper on your side. They're yelling and yelling, and then one day, they're all gone.
Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for you.
(From other room) Get George to put those boxes in the garage.
Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin.
(Trying to match Frank's loudness) So, who says we have to sit in a booth?!
I don't understand why you can't do this for me!
