No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.
Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis.
I want you to go see a psychiatrist.
(to Frank) I told you not to give it to him!
It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm sorry. It's impolite.
(Coy) Ohh.. thank you, Maestro. (Giggles to herself as the Maestro leaves)
(not really noticing Jerry said Hello) Hello, Kramer. Close the door.
What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?
Hey, he only sells them. He doesn't wear 'em.
Well, maybe there's something I can do for you.
Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours.
Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me.
