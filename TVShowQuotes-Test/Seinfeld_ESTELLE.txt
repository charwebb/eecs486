I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this.
You're not Chinese!?!?
Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis.
I always talk about your hands - how they're so soft and milky white..
(Sits down on the couch) Nah, not interested.
But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over!
Frank, I'm cold!
I did not smother him.
Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you.
So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.
Alright, let's go.
Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! I've been waiting for hours!
I'm not betting!
I don't understand why you can't do this for me!
So, is your father excited about coming home?
(Heavy in sarcasm) Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star!
With his friend, Jerry Seinfeld... the comedian...
Move your crap, I'm comin' in!
It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.
Georgie, I'm a divorcee.
Georgie.
Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today, how old would she be?
Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for you.
Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?
Elaine Benes? Oh, she's my son's friend.
You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.
Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours.
You must mean Elaine. Isn't she adorable?
