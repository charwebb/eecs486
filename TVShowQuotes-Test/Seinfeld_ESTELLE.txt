Bye! (Lloyd leaves) Oh, that Lloyd Braun. He is something, isn't he?
This is the only time the doctor *has*.
(not really noticing Jerry said Hello) Hello, Kramer. Close the door.
Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.
It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.
(motherly concern) Cosmo, are you sure you're gonna be alright here alone?
Bosomy? You wanna know if your grandmother was bosomy?!
What are you talking about?! (to Jerry) Have a sandwich.
Well, it's either that or we stay here, near you, and just sit on the money. What do you think we should do, Georgie?
Careful! Careful with the suitcases! We just painted!
(Handing the picture back) You've been cooped up in this room too long.
(Coy) Ohh.. thank you, Maestro. (Giggles to herself as the Maestro leaves)
