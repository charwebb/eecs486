(shouts) Nooh!
It's too thin. They're wearing wide now.
The hell with them.
Why? Why not?! Why won't you go?
I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands?
Me, either.
Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for you.
Ah keep quiet.
Oh!
Ah, your father...
It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.
You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich..
Yesss?
Let me put your father on the phone.
(Interrupting) Tell it to the audience. (George gives Jerry an 'I told you so' look) Here, (Picks up a plate full of sandwiches) I made some bologna sandwiches.
I heard noise.
Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! I've been waiting for hours!
(after George opens the van door) Oh, my god!
I don't understand why you can't do this for me!
Move your crap, I'm comin' in!
I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there.
Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you.
With his friend, Jerry Seinfeld... the comedian...
So, Georgie, we have some big news for you.
How could they have plans?
I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay check every week..
(warmly) Ohhh.
So, I'm getting an eye job.
