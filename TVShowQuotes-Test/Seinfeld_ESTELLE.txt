This is the only time the doctor *has*.
You're not having any of your transvestite parties?
Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.
George, your mother and I, and Kramer (holds Kramer's hand) have been talking.
Maybe you should take a civil service test.
Careful! Careful with the suitcases! We just painted!
Ow! (hits George on the forehead) What's the matter with you?
You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich..
Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?
Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead!
I can't believe it, he was so young. How could this have happened?
Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?
