Well, it's either that or we stay here, near you, and just sit on the money. What do you think we should do, Georgie?
(Heavy in sarcasm) Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star!
Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be gained by feeling a person's material? It's insanity!
You know, I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds anyway, he's an idiot all together. (Knocking at the door) Ah there's Kramer.
(after George opens the van door) Oh, my god!
Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead!
(motherly concern) Cosmo, are you sure you're gonna be alright here alone?
(Let down) Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak.
Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me.
You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.
Georgie.. (Nudges George's arm, disrupting his work with the scissors) Oh, Georgie, would you like some Jell-O?
Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?
