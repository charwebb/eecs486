Ow! (hits George on the forehead) What's the matter with you?
Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin.
I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas?
Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?

So, is your father excited about coming home?
Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy.
I told you. Here, think you know everything?
Oh, I was so worried. (grabs a couple of tissues from the box)
What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building?
Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today, how old would she be?
(Trying to match Frank's loudness) So, who says we have to sit in a booth?!
