Tsst. -we need to let him burn off. Do you take walks with your son?

So the child needs to learn that he's not the most important person in the house.

Let him go. He'll be back. This a good opportunity for you to relax and enjoy your favorite hobby. 

It's okay, this is all part of the dominance struggle.
