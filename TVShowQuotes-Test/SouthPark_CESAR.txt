I am not going to acknowledge the child's attempt at aggressive dominant behavior. Now you eat the chicken. 
Don't look at the child; just keep looking at me. Let, let him know we are having a conversation.
Now before you go read your son his story let's go enjoy a nice quiet cup of tea.
This is more aggressive-dominant behavior. Don't nurture it.
