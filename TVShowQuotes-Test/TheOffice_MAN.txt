All right, I get it. We got a deal.
Do you mind if we share this bale?
If started by accident as these things tend to do. You know, I was setting down my cat, and I accidently put her on top of my dog, and I was, like, so mad at myself at first. And then I was, like, wait. Wait a second.
Eh, you know, it really doesn���t make sense to name the mice. They���re kinda like cannon fodder, you know? You���re not one of those PETA guys , are you? [cat jumps off dog] Oh, great.
