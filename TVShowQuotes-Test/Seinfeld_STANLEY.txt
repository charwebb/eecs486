New File System'.
[singing] Closing time every new beginning���
Do you have any idea how to run an office?
No. I want Tropical Christmas.
[stabs his own leg with a tranquilizer dart and falls to the ground]
Yes.
How many freakin' vampires am I supposed to care about these days?
You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete! Iced tea. Three sugars, five creams.
I usually take a siesta about now.
Are you crazy? I brought Cynthia with me.
That's better. [Michael walks back towards Stanley and the beeping goes up again]
Did you not tell the security guard we were working late?
Perfect, isn't it?
We���ve got all afternoon to talk about that.
Ooh, bring it over.
Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis?
I'm done.
You're a nice guy, Jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins.
Hmmm...
[thinks for a moment] Give me two clients for her.
Ah, I���ve been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old.
I have.
I'm with Pam. Chairs.
I don't think he even uses the bathroom.
Mm, swish.
[on phone] Excuse me one second, please. [to Michael] What is it that you need right now that you can't wait until I'm off the phone with a customer?
Michael?
Mmhmmm.
Dammit Jim! You stole my afternoons, now you stole my line! It's not ���shove it up your butt��� it's....I'll kill you! I'll kill you dead!
Why 'of course'?
Has potential to be your best idea yet. [Michael smiles]
Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes.  I still think he's way overpaid.
A queen size bed is five feet wide. I am not five feet wide, Michael.
Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank. [to Nellie] And you did fire him.
Well somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy.
Just some chef.
So you and Bob are looking at a historical house?
I have an idea for your weekend.
It's this person who's hand I'm holding Michael.
[singing] Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.
Uh hmmmm... .
[Stanley's fork breaks.] Of course.
I heard that.
A sale.
[flashback] Did I stutter?
Woman, you've had a computer for years!
Pass.
What about confidentiality?
Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?
How is that going to work?
There was a car.
I'm sorry?
Any chance Connecticut Casual is Pennsylvania Business, i.e. this is what I'm wearing to your party.
You're firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I'm gonna let you do this to me?
What?
Thank you! [takes pretzel]
You just ignore their carp.
Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply?
It's not right.  I don't like it.
Not maybe. Yes or no.
Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?
I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out.
If your hat hits me in the face one more time--
Ah! So, this is what 2:00 P.M. looks like around here!
Hmpf!
I'm about to die!
I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. [chuckles] I really couldn't be happier.
Cancel wallpaper.
[to Toby, who's filming] You fallin' behind.
I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat. [Kevin is wearing the same hat]
It's too little. Use the phone.
You gotta be kiddin' me.
What we're doing.
I got them a toaster.  They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me.  I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster.  So now my house has got two toasters.
No, Michael, No. [beeping speeds up]
Look, I just want to have a job, Michael. If we don't get these purchase orders...
