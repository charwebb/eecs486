Well, I'll let you boys have your say. 

Alright, let's get him into ER.

Why, hello Chef. Let me guess, pink eye, right?

Now, now, now let's, let's form a line, I've got enough topical cream for everybody.  Ahh!

Oh no you don't, Scott! Leave these boys alone!

Excuse me, what are you doing here?!

Uh huh, and what about food? Are some of the things you thought tasted good tasting like shit to you now, too?

You don't. I'm sorry, there... just isn't enough research in how sarcasm affects the brain.

I want to congratulate all of you for making the effort to come to anger management class.

You're lucky to be alive, young man. Sneaking onto a NASCAR racetrack and hijacking a car for a joyride? That has got to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard of a kid doing! 

Don't worry, young man. We'll make sure everyone understands your disease and gives you the compassion you deserve.

Now, we've all been trying to channel our anger in more constructive ways, Randy. Why don't you share what's bothering you?

Well, you're in luck, I'm happy to inform!
It's only three days until Christmas, so I have lots of abortions to perform!
Gather around my table, cute little lions,
I'll teach you to do abortions without even tryin'!

Well of course you are! And Canada Friends welcomes you!
