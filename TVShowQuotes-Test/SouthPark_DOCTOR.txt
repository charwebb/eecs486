Now I'm just going to check for cysts.  Awww! 
Well just don't let it happen again! Now I'm going to check for cysts.  Arh!  Now stop it! That isn't funny! Babies come from there!  That's it! No PAP smear for you!
I'm sorry, son.  Ms. Cartman, could I have a word with you?  Ms. Cartman, I know this must be... very difficult for you. I for one can't stand red-haired, freckled kids, but you need to understand, there is no cure. Your son will be ginger his whole life. You might want to just... put him down.
Good-bye, friends! Good luck with the new Prime Minister! And remember to watch out for Scott! He's a dick!
It's very normal. Let's just do a quick ear exam. I'm gonna play some Tween Wave music and you tell me what you hear.  What's that sound like to you?
Oh no you don't, Scott! Leave these boys alone!
NO No, I'm not saying that, at all. Please I, I'm just saying how a-, amazing you are for wanting to... l-lessen some of your more... less awesome attributes.
You can't have periods either.  You had a sex change, Mr. Garrison, but you don't have ovaries or a womb. You don't produce eggs.
You don't. I'm sorry, there... just isn't enough research in how sarcasm affects the brain.
Yes, I'm afraid that your son is suffering from gingervitus.
