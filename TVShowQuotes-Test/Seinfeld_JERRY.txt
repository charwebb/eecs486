Are you?
You what?! Get out! (pushes Kramer) Ten thousand?
No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.
The lake isn't real.
Ah, don't worry. I made reser... (catches himself)
So how can you promise her?
Hey, Copernicus?
Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.
Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot.
Its partially you, yeah.
All right. How 'bout this one let's say you're abducted by aliens.
Nah. It's not good for friends to talk about money, it can affect the friendship.
I don't know.
Hey, Ronnie.
You don't understand, someone's after us, a crazy clown is trying to kill us.
Yeah,
I understand (not really understanding, lol).
(Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?
Sure. Bye.
By the way, did you see this? (Hands George a magazine)
Where have you been?!?
Well, what is he, a vampire?
Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?
You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.
You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. (with a British accent) "Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you".
Dermatologist? Skin doesn't need a doctor!
Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I just -
What? He can't do that.
Leo's furious. (He stops in his tracks when he sees Elaine looking at George's book) What is that doing on the table?
What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it.
What hesitate? I didn't hesitate!
Hey.
How do you explain your apartment?
"Hey, by the way, did you ever call that guy from the health club.?"
Well, George doesn't think $13,000 is enough money.
Okay. Hi, Poppie.
She doesn't open...?
Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay?
Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad.
What'd you do to your hair?
Well, whoopie whoop. (Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer staggers in the door in his bathrobe.)
Hey, T-bone!
Seinfeld.
I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.
Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?
Yes you do. That's what you both think.
"I don't think so. I think they were getting dressed and not only that; my shirt was out!!!"
(to Elaine) Harold and Manny.
You can do that.
(suspicious) Well, then what're you doing?
Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations.
Not our "all the way", their "all the way." I got the stink of responsibility on me.
What is the matter with you?
Good idea.
The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right at the other -person.
I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.
Bye, Dad. Take it easy.
First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.
Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.
(moans) Ohhh (walks away)
Unless you're married.
(irritated) Great.
How many years of med school did you have?
They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.
Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?
Let's just make a run for it.
Oh, hello...
No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?
He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris.
Yeah... So's shock therapy.
No I didn't.
What's that?
Swirl.
What is going on out there?
Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.
(to himself) I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles. (answers phone) Hello.
Ramon, what are you doing here? You could get in trouble.
Yeah.
They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.
Ooh.
Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.)
Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.
All right, so I had wooden teeth, so what?
I do.
"I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite."
All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable.
Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?
It's silly!
(fidgets like he has no room with George next to him)... Could you move over there?!
You need to talk?
C'mon...c'mon...
I actually met her a few weeks ago, but... (Jerry stops, and mentally visualizes George telling Susan about how Jerry got Lena's number from the AIDS list...then Susan passing the information along to Monica on the phone at work.)
Hey Kenny. (with some fake enthusiasm, just to be polite)
But you don't smoke.
(Wakes up) Where are we?
No, its okay now, that, that girl is not comin. Uh, I misread the whole thing.
Oh! Come on, you told them you're from out-of-town just so you could stay in a hotel room.
Oh hey Phil.
I cant find the receipt.
Go outside and see if he's still there.
You asked her out?
So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.
He puts 'em on a dental chair.
Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!
So were in the room and shes trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.
See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.
So...
No.
"Guys And Dolls"? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway musical?
Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes outside)
(Yelling out) Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks!
Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?
No.
All right, biff. Elaine, merry-go-round?
You see the thing of it is, there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around, but they don't know they're ugly, because nobody actually tells them.
Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?
Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!
What are you doing?
After one date you try and improvise on her machine?
No, no. It's the valet guy.
..And then she starts talking about her panties.
Oh, that's gotta hurt.
Hey You're staying with my friend George.
I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I dont get this. Arent cows outside most of the time? I dont understand it. When its raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, Let us in, were all wearin leather. Open the door! Were gonna ruin the whole outfit here! Is it suede? I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I cant have this cleaned. Its all I got!
Why, what's up?
That was Elaine , she changed her mind. She's not coming over.
(to Mickey) Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you?
(neutral) No problem.
(answering phone) Y'hello.
You had a date? You went out with my butler? Who said you could go out with my butler?
Nana's missing?
(Casually buttering a roll, like he's the innocent one) I didn't say anything.
And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.
For how long?
Snapple?
Im takin it, Im takin the place. Im gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place. Im livin here...Im movin.
I knew it.
I gotta get to the airport.
Oh!! Let me ask you a question. Was the movie part of the bet?
Oh, I wouldnt quite say that.
No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.
That voice. That voice. Shes driving me crazy.
You'll never say that to her face.
Get off of me.
The wedding is off? What happened?
I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.
Hey, get out of here...hey officer, he's fooling around back here.
Well. This should be a very interesting evening.
I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation.
You mean like.. (points to his hair)
Have you tastes the soup?
What's wrong with your oven?
What's going on?
Beside that. Look at the waitresses.
No, for both!
Um, I don't even know?
So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, "Jerry"? Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it. They're putting it on the air! They're giving us a 13-episode commitment. George and I are moving to California!
(Like an Army general) Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys.
He'll get another job. He's a busboy!
Investigation?
(hands it to him as he asks ELAINE) So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?
Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. That's a tough job. How would you like that?
It did?
Well , now I'm engaged..
Didn't they just have a baby?
I... don't... know...
I think we should separate here actually.
Get a march goin'! March it! (She exits)
Is that from my gift certificate?
Yep.
Nothing.
I don't mind the cemetery.
How can I take it?
Hey. Hey, Mickey. What's going on?
I got isobutane-20.
So George, how do I beat this lie detector?
You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner.
The bags are in the car, I guess we better go.
I told you to take it.
(answering the phone) Hello? Yeah, the van is still for sale. Sure, come on buy.
Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?
Ya how was it?
Hey, how's business?
Gimme that rye.
Oh, what's the point?
Stomach ache?
George?
All right.
Fine, Mrs. Costanza. (Attempts to get Estelle to laugh) Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..
What did you say?
You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world.
Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!
A pinkish hue?
Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of lobster)
I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
(NO!)
Thats what you want to see, yeah. . . . Yeah, you want to trade your hair for some phlegm.
(surprised) He said that?
Are you sure you can't stay longer?
Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.
Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're puttin' it in my box now.
(Joking around) Hey, didn't I beat you up in the fourth grade?
No.
The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.
(hesitatingly) ... no...
(exasperation) You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car cleaned up for my parents.
How long are you suppose to leave it on for?
Sorry, sorry I'm late.
Why don't you just throw 'em out?
Take care now. So long.
I'd rather not talk about it.
It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.
(A couple of days ago I used a public phone), go over time on the call, hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. It's the phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And you got them right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're on the street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a few times, you know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it up, "Yeah, operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... D'you hear that? (taps on microphone) That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that don't you?"
Yeah, Im sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.
Alright Kramer, enough of this. Let's go find George.
What's the matter?
What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of temperament?
Yeah?
Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't.
(to waiter) Ill have a cranberry juice with two limes.
So, um, do you date uh immature men?
Have you ever heard of egg salad?
Two.
(whatever) Fine..
I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high.
Oh. Your ballet tickets.
Tony, y-you better bring that car back!
That's a lot of skin.
You are the Queen of Confrontation. Youre my new hero. In fact, youve inspired me. Im gonna call George about something right now.
He knows?
I think Ive seen enough.
Well, I dont really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.
Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.
That's what a gym teacher once told me.
Oh.
Hi.
That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves, as a result of contact.
Would. Does. Is.
I'll be right back. (Leaves the table.)
Oh, okay..
Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat...
Yeah, I'm a very good boy. I'm flying down there and surprising him.
Oh yeah, well why don?t you Just get lost.
(moving over to block the door) Where are you going?
You gonna be alright here?
People like the idea of revenge. Have you ever heard the expression 'The best revenge is living well' I've said this, in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life. Sounds nice, doesn't really work on that Charles Bronson. kinda level. You know what I mean, those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum. You think you could go up to him, 'Charlie forgot about the 357 what you need is a custom-made suit and a convertible. New carpeting, french doors, a divan. That'll show those punks.'
Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal.
Really? I thought things were going OK.
Hey, Susan, George.
You? How do you know?
That's so funny!
Yellow? I wanted black.
I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?
What's that?
Would you care to join us?
I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!
Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.
All right.
No, I think I would have remembered Memma.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs.
C'mon.
Sorry!
So I dont know what shes using it for.
Hello?
So what happened with Kramer's mother?
Ohh ... (takes the ticket and heads for the dressing room)
Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him.
Sure.
Yeah maybe you should.
I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate'' at 1030.
What? I dunno.
All right lets go.
No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner. Maybe we should ask him.
No! [throws her purse back at her] No, I mean, no thank you, nah...
Well, did you get the ball?
What car?
So how did this all happen?
And they said they can do it?
What, did you lose your remote?
Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...
No, not a thing.
Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around.
Well, break a leg tonight.
Your whole building smells like potatoes.
They could at least try it.
But you were supposed to get me a refund.
all right lets be reasonable, Bania. Im taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think it's a pretty good deal.
So you want me to return it?
Right.
Yeah, he's dating a crayon.
Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.
What happened to Vincent?
Hello.
There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...
Yeah, that's what I said!
I don't know about defraying.
I think I've seen that look.
I get peeved.
This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!
Oh yeah, I know.
(still outside) What was that?
yeah without a doubt, I'm down (Kramer enters) oh hey how're you doing? Jane this is my neighbor Kramer
Go! What could you do?
Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.
I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?
You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?
This one?
I'd like to be.
No, you stay here in the car.
You want something to drink?
He was running from a bee. (Elaine laughs)
L.A.?
Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you.
We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.
I know isn't that something?
What happened to all the towels?
Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.
Hey, what is going on over there?
Let us pray.
You joined the *Polar Bears*?!
Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.
Babu must be back.
Why do I always pay? What am I made of money? You bunch of deadbeats.
Yeah... hes specializing in whales. He's working on lowering the cholesterol level, in whales all that blubber -- quite unhealthy. You know its the largest mammal on earth but as George says "they don't have to be."
What's so special up here?
Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!
Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*.
Yes, it is!
(still Patting) I hear a voice.
Hello, Susan? It's Jerry.
Patty Lawrence had 'em!
What does that mean, good dip?
Hey Todd.
What's his last name?
(Gesturing to Ellen) Kramer, George, this is Ellen.
Mom, you too?
What's going on?
I thought naked is good.
What are you repeating everything I'm saying?
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Jerry.
I don't know.
I have some questions of my own.
Well, we got three bags.
Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I know you?
(looking at Kramer's moustache) Uh, we're not doing that anymore.
Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves, wanted to come home and start working on his floor.
Did I just see that?!
Have you ever been through an audit?
(thinking) This is brutal.
Why not?
One-Q? Whose apartment is that?
okay , bye (to George) What happened , did you take it off?
It has nothing to do with her sister.
What is it your business?
What happened to my stereo? It's all smashed up.
Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.
Hey. It's you! (pointing) Th..that's my Friars Club jacket!
Yeah, sleeping arrangements. So, you haven't, uh...
Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.
Check the pile.
Where do you want to go?
Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do?
Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come on.
Oh and I've got some things of yours here.
Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring to date a giving person.
"So what about the Penthouse. Did you ask him?"
Yeah. I want that coat. (Jerry opens his wallet, looking for the dry-cleaning ticket)
You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head.
You're a shmoopy!
Then what was it?
She's an eskimo, actually.
Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?
Oh, no, the woods! The hole!
Yes.
You're gonna keep these here for eight months?!
How ya doin'?
Where?
Yes, all right, Katie.
Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym teacher.
Ahhh got my laundry back.
You ran over some pigeons? How many?
Maybe we should get you to a hospital.
Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!
You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. Hmmm. What do you want?
Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!
My foot fell asleep.
She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there.
Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you, which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.
You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?!
yeah
Tonight.
Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'
I need a can of balls.
Well you should tell her.
We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)
Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.
(To Elaine) It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's unconscious.
I see. She's looking.
No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it!
Newer magazines.
Awwwwww.
But he was squinting.
Drop one. . . . left!
Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.
It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.
Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically.
(on phone) Come on Adrian give me another chance, I know I could cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act (pauses for response from Adrian) No new material (Elaine enters) He's never heard it. He'll love it, I just did it at the Concord last week, it killed. (waves hello to Elaine; pauses for response from Adrian) Thank you, thanks fo.. you will not regret this. Ok, Bye. (hangs up phone; to Elaine) Hey.
Well, look at this guy. Look, hes got everything, hes got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners.  This is not his first load.
Youre kidding.
Yes, it was.
(whining like Kramer) Ask Newman.
Are saying you're banning me from the store?
That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little off.
Cause you know, I love Elaine.
Yknow I think that even if youve had a relationship with someone, or lets say, especially if youve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, its very difficult. Isnt this? Its hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. Its like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, Look, a rabbit. The other goes, So? I believe this is your card. Look, why dont we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?
Swivel?
Oh, because of all the singing?
What's the big rush?
I know.
Yeah, yeah...
All right.
Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?
It is unbelievable.
(Sarcastic) Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?
I do favors.
Yes.
You know, I don't know the exact pronunciation but I believe its Manage A Trois.
Do me a favor. Just stick around while he's here.
I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.
Now.
George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?
Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time.
Bad.
Well how are you going.....
Yeah, I know she's mad at me, but I really have to speak with her.
Hi Mr. Goldstein is Rachel home?
Wow! Joe Pepitone!
Okay. I wouldn't see it again.
He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.
(Knocking on Kramer's door) Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer home? Oh, hey.
I mean the whole thing, it's just...
You come all the way up here to see a back specialist and you're lifting heavy suit cases.
Your father got arrested? For what?
What do you mean, "kind of."?
What are you eating?
So, Leo, how's everything? You doin' Okay?
This woman's completely ignoring me.
Am I going? It was three nights ago.
No. I never had a job.
You put blood in the car?!
You plunked him.
Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to rides alone.
(explaining) I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the audience, you threw it away. Agrabah.
She did?
Yeah.
I don't know  six three.
You're just out for money!!
What?
Okay, fine. We'll use Newman.
Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?
Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you.
Well what'd you mean?
Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?
No!!! The reason he's the iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away from him, you break his spirit!
You're going to rub out the dog?
Obviously we're gonna call the police and tell that he's not the guy.
Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one.
Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.
Oh I dont know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing.
So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D?
Bania?
No, I kinda tried to test his hearing.
(in a hurry) Yea you're leaving at three o'clock.
No, I'm okay.
But -
Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on.
I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?
You've made some Fine Exits.
What about the soup?
Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature Channel.
No.
Are those the same shoes as yesterday?
Forget the sports jacket.
Alright, but let me ask you this question.
You're out of your mind you know that.
Youre a cashier!
Its raining? Its raining. The game will be postponed. Well play tomorrow.
No, it's tarragon. Hey Kramer, I'm sorry about that whole fight we had about you having my apartment keys and everything.
Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.
Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.
(Jokingly making fun of George) I've never had a really good pickle.
Well, thats a lot of money. But, if thats the way its gotta be, thats the way its gotta be.
Alright, alright, I'll do it!!
No, I don't wanna see the naked people.
She's right, George. Bottle-wipe is big.
The way I feel when I go places with you? (Kramer enters.) Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?
Well you implied it.
(with no emotion) It's okay. Everything is going to be all right.
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.
Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.
Oh, hi Valerie. What's up?
Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.
But I'm not a disturbance!
Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--
Ahh, too bad you got a little, George Costanza thing going on.
"I don't think so."
Thank you. Hi Cynthia.
(exasperated) Where do I find these guys?
So what?
That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.
(as if speaking to a moron) Those belong to people.
What was that?
When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion.
These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waitin' to make that call! (George comes in)
I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.
Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth Whitehead, did I?
No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.
How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a minute. Poppy's from Tuscany. I'm gonna go call him.
Yeah. Yeah.
She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now?
I like that thing in your hair there.
Oh, George Costanza , Kennedy High.
Kramer... (points to Marla)
I was talking to him.
(removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?
Well, we've got to do something. (grabs his phone) I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.
And nothing could change your mind?
What car?
He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?
I'm not carrying a purse.
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!
You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.
Well, I think you're wrong.
Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
No I'm not. (to Michael) George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?
'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off the table.
Oh yeah, how's that looking?
That's disgusting.
I just a ssumed, ...
That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.
Right.
That's nice.
Uh, Huh, yeah.
Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?
Kramer, you're fighting children?!
Where did you come up with all that stuff?
What do you mean? They know we're here.
So what d'you have to do? Pay to keep it clean?
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
So?
You ready for the second one?
No. Yes you can. (he hangs on)
So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?
Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't.
What'ya do with the one you took?
Mentor? You mean your boss.
What the hell are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be at work?!?
Six weeks?
Who would order a license plate that says "Assman"?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?
Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.
Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and--
Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me.
Yeah!
I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction, let's just eat popcorn or something.
Well, we gotta get it washed (pulls off a few flyers)....Ah, the keys are locked inside!
You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?
Hey, guess what? The Drake broke up.
It's all right, she was cheating anyway.
Alright, I'll feel him out.
You gotta shake it up.
Look, she's cutting up an Almond Joy.
Kramer!!!
Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?
Hey, what's happenin.'
(Pats George on the back) Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining room doorway) I think the busboy's in trouble.
Well this is it.
Kramer, why do you have to (noticing Newman) Hello, Newman.
This is ridiculous.
C'mon. Just sit down!
Oooh! I got a pain in my side.
(suspicious) I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.
Hey. What are you doing?
Really? Did you talk to him?
Hey, ??? is rerunning the Yankee game. You watching this?
No kidding?
(consenting) Alright.
Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?
I don't know
And shopping.
All right, I'll see you later.
No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I wouldve said tonight.
Well, I cant wear it.
(Getting a dollar out) Wheres your money?
This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George.
It doesn't work like that.
She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend.
He's not after me.
The store.
Mmm.. Bad how?
You want to go to Mendys, Ill take you to Mendys.
No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant.
Hey, is that my maple syrup? Oh, ya. (Kramer hands it over.)
Alright.
Okay.
There's nothing subtle about that.
What happened?
Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it.
Today, right now! Are you in?
All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy bar).
He can't do that.
(Stammering) Oh, I, I, think I remember..
You and your toilets.
Trouble down at the plant?
What are you doing? Were going out to dinner in ten minutes.
What do you mean, you snubbed her?
Oh, she had an itch.
Yeah , I was doing new material.
Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.
Oh, no. I explained the whole thing to him, he was fine with it.
(pointing at the operation he mouths the words) Did it go in?
Yes, I'm fine.
A little.
Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks.
Is it a lot of cream soups?
Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.
What do you want?
He drove a car with no arms?
(taking a catalog) Can I have one? I need one of those old-looking phones. So you wanna grab a bite?
So it's over?
(Smiling, nodding) Sure, Saturday night.
Well, that's where it gets tricky.
Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.
In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?
(seeing Kramer struggle to open a soda, spilling it all over) I think the damage is probably already done. (interrupting Kramer's inadequate attempt to clean up the soda) All right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene.
No, George was there, he said he had a great time.
Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt?
September 21st, first day of Autumn. Leaves changing colours.. Beautiful colors.
No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get it done.
Yeah.
(tearing himself away from Christie) Huh?
Well, what happened?
I, I love that George.
Snowball? You were afraid of Snowball?
Yeah, me too.
No, absolutely nothing. (They get up to leave) You're fantastic! (They meet up with Kramer and George on the way out) Hey guys!
Oh my god.
I didn,t tell you to park in that lot .. Now someone's gonna have to drive you every time you need your car.? Take the bus!
It can't be worse than this.
The Chinese , the Chinese bald cure.
Why should I be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer to town hall than yours?
We'll see.
That's very nice, I guess.
Catnap?
Flowers?
I think I heard her say something about a bench.
So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?
Me too.
(to George) That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said.
Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.
I can see that. What's it for?
Well, at least taste it.
Where?
Paul again?
No, it's too trendy, no Isabella's.
Yeah, got it from the bank.
There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?
Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?
Cant you talk to your boss?
You can't prove anything.
Of course.
You stink worse than I do!
They have a piano backstage they warm up on.
Hello?
Right above me.
Really?
Uh... sure/yeah..
Yeah, no one's reading any rolled-up messages in a knish...
What do you mean like post-cards an...?
Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.
Boy...
So, are you going to leave?
This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.
Hard to say.
How much was it to clean the vest?
He did?
Don't look at him. (Phil starts to knock on the door)
Hey!
Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen? Maybe he's setting me up!
Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.
What, do you think I care about the money? Is that what you think? You want me to show you what I care about money? Here look, here look at this, here's a dollar here look, there, that?s how much I care about money.
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.
It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. It got to me. And that orgasm stuff orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure!
It has a certain understated stupidity.
Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those...''. ``I hate those... I love those...''. And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M and a light brown, M&M. That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. "Well, your red is more of a main course M&M, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor; it's an after dinner M&M, really''.
You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.
Hello?
Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.
Why?
Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.
That?s what I?ll do, I?ll just call him and tell him, I?ll tell him. That?s all I?ll do. He's a human being, I?ll talk to him. He'll understand. Right?
It's not bad.
So, how did you meet him?
Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really.
The Truth.
Maybe, maybe
Horses? Theyre like big riding dogs.
Miss.
What?!!
Why?
Hello, Newman.
Hi
I dont return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.
What about you, George?
(Looking down at the shirt; mumbling) Oh, thank you.
I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, its very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say, Call the police. You really should call the police. So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, Yeah, Im calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... Im gonna see some real action. Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out The Report. They give you Your Copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I dont really think were gonna crack this case, do you? Its not like Batman, where theres three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin. I think we can round him up, hes dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him, hes a PENGUIN!
And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldya?
But theyre talking about nothing.
I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.
Alright.
It's Kramer.
"How's George?"
Yes.
George...
Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.
Oh, like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? Shopping carts with one bad wheel?
who do you think she is? how dare she? you want me to get the manager? too bad they don't have those old ladies walking around with flashlights anymore we'd flush her out
(on the phone) Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Ya. Oh, really? Okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye. (hangs up the phone) Well, the yogurt verdict is in. (Kramer looks at Jerry with his arms out) Fat!
Well what about me?
Just relax, you'll be fine.
How much?
The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.
Why? What happened?
Oh its your cat!
Oh, what are you doing here?
He asked me if I was doing anything Friday night.
Do you not like apple pie?
Yeah.
Elaine...
Right. For the reducing of the pond scum?
hmm. (nodding head)
It's brown.
Sure, how much?
Now of the course the thing is Extreme sports. Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. It's like a Wiley Coyote idea isn't it? The thing I wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets? Can you almost make it? Why don't they just wear a party hat? What's the difference? You jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute doesn't open I got news for you, the helmet is now wearing you for protection. Later on the helmet's talking to the other helmets going "boy it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly."
No he's going downtown to guard the suit.
Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.
Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.
Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.
Yeah, it was a gamble.
(Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?!
Kramer, what are you doing here!?
Yeah, and?
Where are they moving to?
The car!
Here?
I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.
But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.
Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!
Hello?
All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a mnage  trois with her and her roommate.
So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?
(to Bania) Excuse me. (he goes back in the dressing room)
Yeah.
I don't know.
There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?
She wants to be back on yours.
Why don't you just get rid of it?
We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.
So forget about the books. Did you read them?
You know who that is? That's
Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the glass to get Kramer's attention, Elaine laughs) Maybe it's time you got a different hobby.
Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.
Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck.
I can't believe she threw that out. I had like the perfect wording of a whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it.
Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,
Course you may not see it for twenty years.
Uh huh
(Walks over and starts pulling on Kramer's pants) You just gotta wiggle your hips a little bit.
All right, forget it, forget it. Im not taking the place!
Trouble
Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed.
Just imports, no exports?
Oh.
It doesn't?
Yeah, I looked. I saw.
But you know... not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me.
You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.
Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?
Three.
Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards.
The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting out that marriage.
See?
So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets... A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world He's Boring.
I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it.
Well, if I hear an anguished "oink", I'm outta here. I-I don't see any pig-men. Look (HE POINTS AT PASSERBY) Human, human, human... (HE LOOKS DOWN CORRIDOR, WITH ALARM.) (WITH MOCK ALARM) Wait a second! (Grabs Kramer)
I just hope that whole pony incident didnt put a damper on the trip.
Ah, I'm one kind.
(on phone) But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that?s not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what?s the difference, I?m a comedian of the United States, and I?ll tell you I?m under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye.
Not good.
You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.
Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. (Kramer picks up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.) Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine! (Kramer starts filling a pot with water.) What are you doing with that?
I can?
Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner.
(quietly) Mm-hm.
Hello.
You and George got together?
No. No. I don't mind at all.
Hey Phil how you doing?
(Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn - grabbing a fistful) Listen, I - I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) There's been a terrible misunderstanding See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone, and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) "Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone." (Back to normal) You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. (To Elaine, whispering) Now she wants to have a drink with me. (Elaine mouths out "Just go" while making gestures. Jerry, again, gives in. Back on the phone) Yeah, I think I can.. Um.. yeah, I know where that is.. Ok.. uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. (Hangs up, peeved) Now I gotta have a drink with her.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, whats going on?
Alright, I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine.
What, your sad little horsies, the house with the little curl of smoke, the sunflower with the smiley face. the transparent cube... (as she leaves)
No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!
Ive got a ballpark.
I... uh....promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her.
Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.
What? What is it?
No, no the junior.
(trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents.
Elaine, you're among friends.
Why? Why are they doing that?
(livid) Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one!
I look about the same.
I don't think so.
No, no. I'll take the subway.
Like with dogs.
Yeah.
It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make.
Whats the difference?
Uh, he's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling us to see the baby.
He can't hear us.
I got a date with that girl, Lena.
I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.
I don't know.
Really, you're getting that good?
No, she's not.
So very gorgeous.
I'm going.
I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll come by five after seven right after they leave.
All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I will give you double what you paid for it.
Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.
Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight. Let's live a little. .
What d'you mean, could've?
Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little longer)
Hes an importer/exporter.
You're marchin' in.
I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society.
Especially when you got a layover in Sarajevo. (Bosnia Herzegovina)
All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier. (Elaine drinks straight out of the orange juice container) Hey.
Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night. (Rachel shocked)
I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space.
(confused) He what?
I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over.
See? You give, and you get.
Yeah! I think I got flea bites.
Hang on.
How do you know?
She died.
Awright, let's eat already.
Hey, would you mind switching seats?
The bris?
No kidding. (thinking) Why is this happening? Please, make her stop!
H-Hey, Kramer, wait up. I'll go with you.
Oh, you want to try the syrup! (Meryl smiles and takes it. The waitress comes over.)
Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila.
Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?
So, what did you say?
The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like youre always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. Youre out somewhere with people, Gee, you look pregnant.. are you? Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, thats not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Lets take this whole scene again. People, think about what youre saying!
(Bitter) Good night, Newman.
Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them.
Yes.
I don't want to trade.
Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!
I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite?
You look like Brenda Starr.
I think theres a mental hospital near here.
I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or something.
Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies, they wrap him up in a towel, and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big sunglasses case.
Seen any good movies lately?
Is this a problem?
Uh huh. Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?
What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?
I get it.
So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? I'm gonna try to sell the van to a lot.
I used it up
Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck.
(startled) Kramer!
Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?
What?
What do you think?
What are ya gonna do?
Hey. So, keys?
I will, I just walked in the door.
You crying from "Home Alone"??
Your core temperature?
Hey, what's going on over here?
You cried?
You like that commercial?
What?
Don't you need a little... help?
Hey Sid.
Gina, do you know what a Drakes Coffee Cake is?
I'll have a cup of coffee and a turkey club.
I did not bail out on you.
No, he's still stuck at the foundation.
No.
What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying...
Oooh.
You and me.
Good work Kramer, this is incredible.
How could you swim in that water?
Male roommate, huh?
Oh, okay, thanks.
You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?
But is this an emergency?
(talking to George) It's working. (to the girl, who's tapping on the aquarium) Don't tap on the glass.
And what's gonna happen?
Yeah, only for a while.
You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon.
Can I have my keys...
I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?
Kramer, who'd you sell your ticket to?
Done.
What do you mean?
Oh, a walk, well --
Just put it under your shirt.
Yeah.
So are you...
Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel?
If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him.
Son of dad?
So, did these thieves want any money?
What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself! (mimicking the letter) I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness!
Thats different. I didnt have feelings for those people. But you, youll backslide
We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.
(Rejecting) Ohh, no. No, no, no..
Let me have a look at this thing.
Well not technically.
So, break it.
Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.
He offered it to me.
Let me see that. (Jerry looks at the tag.) That is high.
Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots!
C'mon, seriously...
Scary cold.
There it is!...No, no that's a Toyota.
So you don't care if I die.
Whats the difference?! Thats the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!
Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
Actually it's being taken care of right now.
I wouldn't think so.
Line two?
Because I gave it to you.
Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth something.
Ahh, Im a 40. Why?
What is goin' on in there?
This is really too much.
Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day?
(Introducing the two) George, this is Nina.
What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha ha!
Hmm, I really need to speak with him.
Give me that rye!
(back in booth) He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us outside. This is a great way to go through life.
O.K. (closes the apartment door)
Ah, you're better off. Now you can just let it go.
Yeah. Because she threw out my napkin.
Come on, I'll go with you.
New couch, baby!
Ah, no problem. That's fine.
You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake.
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.
Charity?!? That's apalling.
I did.
Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door [Jerry pushes his door against Kramer's entrance]
Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. (Nervous under the pressure; Fulton not finding anything Jerry is saying funny) Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.
I can't believe it.
No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a van guy.
All right, I'll call 911. Think he did it? Could've he done it? Couldn't done it? How could've he done it? Couldn't be? Could it? Hello 911? How are you? I'm sorry it was just a reflex...I know it's an emergency number...it is an emergency...my friend is being accused of being a smog strangler and I know he didn't do it...they're putting me trough to the detective in charge of the investigation...what is my name? Who am I? I'm eh...George Costanza...
What bet?
Excuse me, Mother?
I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.
(Nodding) Yeah, the other guy.
Hey you know when Superman saves someone no one asks if he's trying to hit on her!
That's what she told me!
Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?
By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you book it for the millennium New Year?
(Pointing) Hey, there's Leo.
What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn. (acts like he did in the movie) Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll. (does the next look) I mean, beyond that, Im risking a punch in the mouth. (To a stock boy) Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?
What happened here, Kramer?
Oh, really?
Thank you very much.
I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...?
Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.
So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?
I understand.
Hey.
You want to trade me an undershirt?
About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?
Hey.
He took what out?
Who's she?
What? Why? What happened?
Why what happened?
What is that music?
Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.
David Putty used *my* move?
You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.
How come you're eating your peas one at a time?
Yeah... Because they would be very demanding people.
Yeah, me either. (he takes her other hand and put it on his other shoulder)
We're four months apart.
(Scolding) George. (To salesman) Sorry, were just waiting for David Puddy.
I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?
Towards what end?
Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower.
You're telling me.
Oh, now you're being ridiculous.
So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?
(on phone) Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago.
Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.
She suggested it!
I hired her from a service!
Hello
Oh, I know her. I know her type.
But that's you.
Yeah, take it easy. (Leaves)
Ill have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.
Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display.
Alright. So?
Yeah, it's in the kitchen drawer.
Hey. How was the Rainbow Room?
Uncle Leo, wait!
Who am I?
South America?
I'll pass.
Buyer beware.
all right. One second.
Why would anybody want a friend.
(Persistent) Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way.
I just don't understand the raisinettes.
(accusingly) Hey, this is the zee page of my address book.
Aloe. So where's that lock smith?
Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do?
Who is it?
What?!
What was that?
Well, ...
Uh-huh...
Why are you looking at my face?
That's shocking, but sounds ...
You told him you knew Simons?
Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery.
I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.
Yeah.
I could, but I choose not to.
... as long as one of them is not him.
Hi.
Oh, sorry.
So, are you gonna go out with her?
What?
Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity.
I've gained eight.
I don't know.
So?
Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.
Being really clean and happy?
Okay, fine. (Jerry takes a coin from his pocket.) This is the official flip. No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and thats it. Agreed?
Ah, she's okay.
I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl here, every big fight....
I've never done it before.
Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?
Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally.
Let's check out the glove box. (Opens the glove compartment, takes out a pencil.) Ah. Pencil.
Kramer this is Ramon, from the new health club I joined.
You know, if your future was a little more certain..
Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?
I just said that.
Bye.
How's it doing?
Maybe.
Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... (to himself, cursing her) Mulva!
No, go ahead. Look at this place. I cant wait to get it cleaned.
Are you saying...
No, did you?
Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...
Ten minutes.
You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone and see what they think.
No, I don't.
Wow! Hey, theres Clare. I better go down.
Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.
You're not gonna get the job.
Try Elaine.
Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.
Oh, it won't be for that long.
NO.
Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket?
We're straightening out!
Why wouldnt he?
Where are you going?
Alright, alright. I'll wake 'em up.
Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?
(disbelief) Milos?
He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me anything.
Nah, Ill go get the robe.
(watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans?
You got the job?
I guess that's all right.
All right, all right.
Tony.
All I said was I liked the pen!
He's going' out with you on Friday?
What're you doing here?
I'm finding that out. (Kramer enters)
Ya, I could see that.
Yes.
I'll pick you up at your apartment. We'll go to the Eight.
(deadpan) I think you need more sleep.
No! Stop it! Kramer, stop it!
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?
What is it?
Have you noticed people staring at your head?
Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese food, there's leftovers.
I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door)
(Shaking his head no) Pff.
What the hell he's supposed to be on medication I don't understand he told me he's getting medication what happened to his medication!?
Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's.
Can I take a guess?
I'm not *saying* she's deaf, she's deaf.
Gotta support the team.
Look Ramon, about the other day. Im sorry if I offended you. I get a little crabby on the subway.
Hi Jack.
Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...
What ever happened with the shirt?
The guy with the lizard.
There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.
Did you look at look at this picture carefully?
To the Paul Simon concert in the park!
Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction.
The...black, leather...thing with a strap.
(quiet) Huh. Alright.
You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing!
I'm heading over to Elaine's.
No.
Yep..
No. No thanks.
I don't know, but we don't have much time.
Yes, Lupe. I'm blaming Lupe.
Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did?
Yeah.
Dylan Murphy.
Never happened.
What?
Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun?
You know Jeffery?
I'm on the phone!
Everybody's moving to Seattle.
Elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man?
Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here...
oh my god
I mean, what's the deal with cancer?
He has no idea who you are.
Yeah.
People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.
Good to have you back.
Well you said they could come and take the records.
Shut up, you old bag!
Yes, it's very strange. Very strange.
Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.
Mmmmmm!
I don't know. So what's this job of yours?
So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out Im giving you a raise.
If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.
The hospital?
What are you doing? Were going out for dinner in ten minutes.
Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo.
George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.
Maybe he was just trying to be nice.
They're musicians. That's not a joke.
Well be sure to catch a Broadway show while you're in town.
Look who's here! Georgie-boy!
You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.
You know what that makes you?...A baldist.
I really wanna have fun.
You think?
No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!
(picking up his bag and coat) Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?
Yeah, it's a puffy shirt.
So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day...
You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had my chance and that's that.
Well, I do.
Well, keep looking.
Yes. (To Jenny) You're sure there's nothing we can do?
(On the phone) Nina, Hi. It's Jerry.
If I like their race, how can that be racist?... Hellooo??... Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!... Yyy-yes, I am calling George... Oh, the lines are crossed! You're getting his calls. Well, what do you know?!
Come on, lets go.
Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to the papers?
The one Puddy screamed at in the car?
Elaine?
We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?
Thirteen thousand.
who?
Kramer, you can't talk to Frank.
I told it. (Answers the buzzer) Ya?
I want to but I can't.
No, I asked him.
Bomb threat.
Wait a second, you got the Mark McEwan TV Guide.
Am not.
Bagels?
That is right, somebody else was driving.
Gwen! How'd you know I was here?
So he's been lying to me for two months?!
We'll call him...
Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk.
Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?
You're not qualified to work at the catalog.
Well, you want to sit with George? I think he's coming with Robin.
An overdose of odor? Good question.
You know 'm just curious, How did you know she wasn't my girlfriend?
Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding sir - lighten up. How about you, what are you in for?
Come on.
You've really gone mental.
I don't know what I was thinking.
Open the package Leo.
Yeah.
Well "six" and "sex" are close.
You think she's got toes for thumbs?
I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? (hides meat in napkin in jacket)
I-
Kra _ mer!
You're walkin' like Frankenstein!
Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?
(together -- with arms extended -- palms upwards) Stan The Caddy.
Why??
Aren't they supposed to be rolling cigars?
I can do that.
Hey. What are you doing?
You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying "I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street."
Hey look at this. What is going on here?
Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?
Again?
Thats got nothin to do with it.
Hi Pam.
Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.
Ohh.
Hey. What's the matter?
Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. (Holds lettuce head) Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts the intellect, represented here (Pulls off tiny piece of lettuce), and the part obsessed with sex. (Shows large piece) Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence. (Eats tiny piece of lettuce)
I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.
OK.
Can't hear a thing.
Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.
No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.
Yeah, so Joey?s a great lover of the opera
Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?
Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?
And?
You know what it was, bad location.
Oh there's nothing to see.
Of course, they're polyester.
Oh, that's gold, baby.
Oh, no thanks.
Hey.
(resumes) ...you know, make a good impression.
Actually, it was a ********.
Would you give him the TV back?
(Talking to Elaine) You ate more bread?
Did you follow the recipe?
Here we go...
Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this!
What if he doesn't call now out of spite?
I heard something.
You got me the air conditioner?
Youre not
(Trying to block out Kramer, he starts to sing along with the TV) The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus..
You know, the basic idea of negotiation, as I understand it, is to get your price to go... up.
Hey, look, there's Bobby Eighteen?s father-in-law, Mr Reichman. George and I were just talking about that today, I can?t believe it! That?s the guy who threw George out of the wedding.
... I think. Have some more wine. (Jerry pours his whole glass of wine into her glass.)
You see?
Really! Socks!
By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work.
Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back.
Yeah.
Yes I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's condition...
Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.
Ah. (makes face)
What if she's having an off night?
Absolutely. I have no confidence in you.
(angry) Oh, you idiots!
Can I help you?
Hello, Newman.
Someone's cooking.
Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!
Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving? There's no grace period.
It's killing me. (Makes a move)
How could they not fire you?
No.
Federal Express? Come on up. . . . Federal Express. I'm not expecting a package.
This is George, this is Kramer.
He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.
you napkin I'm dripping
Beautiful.
Yeah , she's coming to see my act tonight.
(uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.
She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective?
(Excited) I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!
(Interrupts) Excuse me...Excuse me... Are you asking him out ?
They lost.
Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions.
I mean I'm happy sometimes, but-but not now.
Oh. Hello, Tetanus.
She lives with her parents.
Not if you have a doctor's note.
Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. (To George) So, you goin' to the funeral?
She said she'll do it.
I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.
We gotta confess.
Hey.
(leaving too) Yeah. Yeah.
How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon, let's just go.
What did I do?
Farfel?
Ok buh bye. Have a good time.
(Apologetically) Oh, I'm sorry. Maestro.
What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must be something. What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks?
Okay...
They're closed.
Ah, he'd just deny it.
Hm.
But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.
Was it pimple popper MD?
I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after 'thank you'?
Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it?
That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.
No reason...
Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange?
Are you sure?
No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!
But I, I didn't, I--
(To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?
Who's it from?
Why?
What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell her?
Oh, the best revenge is living well.
I did.
I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?
(animated) You know, I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because I thought you knew what you were talking about.
Get in the car! Get in the car!
He fired you?!?
To wash my hands. Theyre sticky from the orange.
Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.
Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it.
If not now, when?
No, go ahead.
Ask him to change it.
You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.
No, I do not challenge.
Hi.
Wow! Good work, Nancy Drew
Not everybody likes everybody!
You don't look well.
You're not Cartwri-
How do you know?
Really?
How d'you know?
No.
(stares into coffee cup and looks back at George) Problem?
we're expected to be superficial
What's wrong with him?
What?
But...
It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?
I don't know. Maybe.
I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the tiles.
Relax. Who are they?
Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop.
Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?
Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.
Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.
I said no! (hangs up the phone.)
Well thank you very much, it's about time.
Would she mind?
You what?
Maybe!
But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?
Let's not even analyze it.
Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign.
You see?!
Alright! (picks up the phone and dials) Hello, Alec? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. You know, you got a great 'John Houseman' name. Alec Berg. Did you hand in your assignment, Mr. Berg?
(seeing Fredo's tombstone) Oh, my God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up! (hands the shovel to Kramer)
C'mon..
But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!
Who?
How's the gas situation?
"I don't like him."
I will.
Hi Willie.
Adjacent to refuse, is refuse.
Yeah
How could you eat fish on a plane?
See ya'.
Yeah.
Ah, I'm so sorry.
Told you.
The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?
What floss? When?
I always get confused in the movie theater by the, by the plot. It's embarrassing. It's an embarrassment to have to admit, but I'm the one that you see in the parking lot after the movie talking with his friends, going, "Oh, you mean that was the same guy from the <beginning>... Ohhhhhhhhhh..." Nobody will explain it to you. When you're in the theater, you can't find out. [whispering to imaginary friends seated around him] "Why did they kill that guy?... Why did they kill him?... Who was that guy? What was the... I thought he was with them? Wasn't he with them? Why would they kill him if he was with them? Oh, he wasn't *really* with them.... I thought he was with them. It's a good thing they killed him.''
Do you remember the curse toast?
Imagine, us narks?
I strained my neck last night.
No, I mean, I don't think so.
Nice looking Lugar.
(tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggage, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangements, but we can't seem to be friends when we sleep together.
Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that!
Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! What drives me to take chances like that?
You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca?
Oh, great. Ok we'll goin' away. I think I'm excited.
(Sees Elaine leaving) Hey! Wh-where are you?
Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic.
Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him to his party?
(tucking in his shirt) Oh ya this is Rachel.
And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you thinking?
Ooh!
So you didn't get the job.
This is my friend George.
Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.
Pull yourself together. Your going in there soldier! That's an order!
No. No lunch.
Like fire in a school is such a big deal. (Kramer enters)
Hello, Newman!
Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?
Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.
(walking out) Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight everybody.
Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours. (And with that, Jerry made the most fatal mistake of his life)
Yeah.
The Inka-dink.. You were It.
Uh, well. It, uh...
Oh, I got the machine.
Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by the big showcase tonight.
Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...
Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
Had I been taking...?
Lemon Tree.
Do you think this is such a good idea, with you being on the verge of this big promotion?
Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?
Well, I take it very seriously.
Yes!
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian guy is the guy you want.
Are my nostrils getting bigger?
No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him.
I don't know. They're, backed up.
Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.
Excuse me, what?
Myanmar.
Can I - can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I can't believe this, I make one innocent comment, about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you?
Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (picks it up again)
You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To me the worst thing is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help?' 'No, just getting some air.'
Yeah?
Can we just go?
What was the dream?
Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.
Not because youre dirty, not because youre clean  just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine...
A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!
What about all your Jewish jokes?
What?
Oh, good, men love that!
You really want to?
Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!
You can do that.
Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.
For what?
It was funny!
........For spite...
..She was sitting at the table where I had my tape recorder...Okay great. Thanks again.. bye. HA Ha..Who do these women think they're dealing with? Did she think she was gonna leave this incredibly erotic message on my tape and I was just gonna let it go. Not Bloody likely...
You think so?
Yeah, the lobster'll scare him.
Anything else?
Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, "That's not a bad idea."
Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.
Hello
(still watching tv; sounds like basketball) Bottle-wipe supercedes it.
Yes, I poo-poo.
Does it ever bother you that this organization-
Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.
