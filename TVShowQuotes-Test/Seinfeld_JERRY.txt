What, she gave me hives?
Oh, gross. That's not gonna be good for business.
I didn't make a deal. I just shook your hand.
I don't know, it's ten dollars.
Why not?
Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.
Risk management?
No, nothing.
Have you ever called someone up, and you're disappointed when they answer the phone? You wanted the machine. You know, and you're always kind of thrown off, (left hand up to side of face, pretending its a receiver) you go "Oh, I eh, I - I didn't know you were there, I ah - just wanted to leave a message saying, sorry I missed you."
(feeling face) Good shave today...
I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?
Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure.
I can start right away.
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.
Oh, no.
It's Isosceles
I dont really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because theres that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, youre sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, Im really sorry about this. I dont know why I left that stuff over there. And thats why I could never be a maid, because Id have an attitude. Id find them, wherever they are in the house, Oh, I suppose you couldnt do this? No, dont get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldnt dust. No, this is too tough, isnt it?
Sing it, sister!
(annoyed) How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? Besides it's not a submarine and there's no room for a periscope in a car.
Hey, how ya doin'? Y'know I got that reporter from the newspaper on the other line.
Hey, Elaine. Did you get my message?
People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.
What are you looking at? (Kramer goes out onto the terrace and looks down.) Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold.
Did he overdose?
Yes.
Ahh.
What's the matter?
It means "Death to tyrants".
(shocked) Your husband?!
hello. Oh, hi. What's happening?  what? oh um, sure,  um, yeah, okay, uh. I'll see you then. Yeah, yeah, Bye.
I told you!
Yea but...
George, the man wept.
Can I use your phone?
She likes talking during sex.
What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not sure this is a dog.
Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?
You mean Florence Nightingale. **
It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?
Ah, no problem. That's fine.
When did this happen?
What's your problem.
What idea?
Where are we?
So it could be anyone?
(flips a roll of paper towels in the air) Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.
I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.
That's my ticket!
I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.
..What is this?
Elaine? What does she have to - (notices Newman looking up at him longlingly.) Oh no...
Whats to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.
Oh, did he like it?
"Ahh! You too with these?"
Obviously.
Hi.
You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts.
I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!
What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!
You know you're not supposed to drink while you're keeping a secret! (Elaine laughs) Is there anything else?
What the hell is that?
You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! (Snaps) They're cloning sheep now.
(lacking enthusiasm) Yeah, yeah.
Why is he scared.
Do you remember the curse toast?
All right. But then I can't tell you the BIG news.
Hey, should we say something to him?
Well, we've got to do something. (grabs his phone) I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.
What, are you nervous?
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!
Hot dog?
What if she sees me?
You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing?
(Scoffing) Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.
Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal.
How do you know?
What do you mean replace it?
No....
You, sidle? Y-You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale!
I can't believe she threw that out. I had like the perfect wording of a whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it.
Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look I?m serious, I?m not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it.
I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this.
What do you mean, you got it?
Aw! You'll be fine, you were in there for what , a couple of minutes.
Maybe they're admiring your spot.
What is that song?
How do you pull that off?
'Kay. (Buzzes them in.)
I'm freakin' out! I am freakin' out!
I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings)
What's the difference?
We had quite a little chat.
How is that possible?
Did you write it down?
Someone says, Get out of my life, and that doesnt affect your appetite?
Elaine, have you noticed George was acting strange the whole flight?
well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.
Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?
I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? Thats what I want to know. I mean, its the championship, Im hitting everything.
So good for you.
I'll have a cup of coffee and a turkey club.
Uncle Leo! (releasing his grip) Alright! Take it!
You got a lot to learn about pancakes.
Y'know I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle.
Yes you do. That's what you both think.
George, I want you to promise me something. If Im ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.
So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?
Well, she'll still be an ex-con.
Tic-Tacs work?
IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE!
Uh... sure/yeah..
Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf.
Me?
Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes.
I am. It was the world's first.
How 'bout those Knicks?
Take it.
Oh.
Hey
Uh-huh, yeah. (Smiling, nodding, clearly wanting Bryant to shut up)
(Gives Elaine a look) No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.
Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole.
You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.
Yeah, sure we will.
I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out.
Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was that?'
(gesturing) This is Gary.
(to George) No. (to Kramer) I told you not to say anything.
You know 'm just curious, How did you know she wasn't my girlfriend?
Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream.
[To Rep] I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.
hunky.. Tony.. hey hey hey (fools around with his collar again)
(playing Scrabble with his naked girlfriend) Zephyr? That is not a word.
(struggling to open a bottle with his bandaged finger) I can't do it. (A LA GODFATHER) Look what they did to my boy, They massacred my boy.
I didn't do anything.
Yes. And the mentor advises the protg.
Ill give you a year.
Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?
Hey You're staying with my friend George.
I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.
You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice.
Goodnight.
How about adult contemporary?
Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?
Yeah.
Fine, if I'm off yours.
Well...actually, we kind of broke up.
(deadpan) No.
You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?
Forget the bench.
They said they were interested in me.
Kramer?
I guess we like to think we've progressed beyond a knife fight for a citrus drink.
What?
Very tasty.
Yes, yes, I do.
You didn't ... (makes motion like he's lighting a cigar)
What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started screaming "There he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!" And then, when they all run into the other direction, we'll jump in the car!
So where're we eatin'?
Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivian's.
(Gets up, and displays his own hands) Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.
So you have no car?
Not if you have a doctor's note.
Really...
So, did you two, uh,  have uh,
Not once.
Mom, Dad.....I have fleas..
But he's an old man, Elaine.
Oh, come on.
There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a "Smell Gestapo". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush...
Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, "Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms."
First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call?
When George was growing up..
The third?
So what happened with Kramer's mother?
So, break it.
What is that sound?
Why not you call him Maestro.
What do you mean like post-cards an...?
Ok buh bye. Have a good time.
They serve soup at 6 a.m.?
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second. ! Celebrate! How about some champagne?
Two pair? Three of a kind?
You sure?
I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction, let's just eat popcorn or something.
Alright, that's very good. Thank you.
Oh so what.
What happened to Vincent?
I'm sorry, I..
No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.
I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.
I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a "magical world" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.
There's nothing wrong with my career!
I can't go if you're mad.
Wait'll you get to know him.
Hi.
Yeah, yeah...
Hey.
I tried to do that.
Leave it. What about your back?
And she said "Yes"?
No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street?
I think I got David Duke and Farrakhan down there.
Yes, that is a definite possibility.
Oh my God is that the new perfume?
He asked me to. We were getting along.
Why would I freak out? (To himself) Pilot...
What are you doing?
What are you doing? Were going out for dinner in ten minutes.
Hi Bob.
Oh my god, it's Bania and Jenna.
(Mesmerized) What are you, a scientist?!
Well, here we are...
Oh, man!
Who would pay that much?
What a surprise.
That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his fathers band. Hed loan it to you.
Oh, heh. You know, a friend of mine has a watch just like that. I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.
Oh, come on, be a come-with guy.
John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine.
Positive.
So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?
OUR LIVES!! . What kind of lives are these? We're like children. We're not men.
What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?
Yeah.
I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first one.
Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways.
And you are?
She's playing, Pagliacci?s wife, Nedda.
(Making nothing of it) So? Who cares about that?
Oh, no don't say that. You'll jinx me.
And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?
Well, we need change and all I have is twenties.
Well it's very emasculating..
Because you threw it out.
Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.
Oh, come on!
Ah, no wonder we're getting so much rain.
Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.
I'm not *saying* she's deaf, she's deaf.
I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest.
I don't want to stop her!
Hi.
It's hard enough living next door.
Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and--
I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.
Yeah.
Hey Matthew.
Back and to the left Back and to the left
Green suit, power ring.
Yeah, come on Elaine, lets go.
Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving.
I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing!
You got a problem with paba?
So what are calling me six times a day?
That's enough!
You want him?
What do you mean, you snubbed her?
Yeah! Because of you.
I gotta do some research here.
"I don't like him."
You kissed her?
She was looking for someone to go to the show with.
(having an idea) I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.
Hey.
Yeah, I think you would.
Grandpa clothes, I cant wear em.
Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks.
Really?
Come on.
Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment.
Alright. So?
Manly.
He's from a.. Yakima, right?
I know.
Who's got a tissues? I need more tissues! Look at this thing. It's my phone finger!
Well I...
My jacket?
No you go on ahead, I'll take the bus.
Oh yeah? What did you talk about?
Oh, because of all the singing?
Not possible.
Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off.
Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.
And she was beautiful in that bra! I'm crazy about her! I love her whole free swinging, free wheeling attitude!
Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic.
Boy, you are really hungry.
Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?
Hey. Why didn't cha get the big one?
Newman. He's going with Newman.
It's not bad.
Well, you're looking well.
But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike.
I see you there Ramon.
"Well , where is it?."
there are no copies.
Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race, he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!
(Surprised) Huh?
They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) "What do they look like."
What?
Hey.
Honey... Aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday?
She's not there!
Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? To me tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. "That'll be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh."
How come you're eating your peas one at a time?
(tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggage, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangements, but we can't seem to be friends when we sleep together.
I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?
Ah, Tim Whatley. Out scalping?
(getting it) Ahh. Wit-chay Woman.
She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!
I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.
I know, I feel bad about that...
No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed.
Mmmmmmmm!
I don't know , Who keeps track of Hellos.
What did he say?
So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.
Walk away?
What's it like out?
You're just out for money!!
Yeah.
And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.
Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl. (pause) Did you?
I guess he graduated.
(consternation) Oh no. (to the bedridden two) It's go time.
(Like an Army general) Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys.
Okay, okay. I'll be right back.
Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line.
Okay, sixty bucks from Nana.
This is too much.
So put 'em in a safe place.
(As George sits down) George, we need to talk.
(Looking toward beach) Oh this is interesting.
I mean, she called me. I havent called her. She started it.
c'mon, c'mon....
Youre kidding.
(sardonic) Oh. (smiles)
I got you an apartment in the building.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term.
What is that music?
Seen any good movies lately?
What?
Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.]
It has a certain understated stupidity.
If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.
Oh no.
Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!
Here, what is that?!!
Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house  and then I saw it in your house.
Yep. Since college. (Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.) Hey, Lena Small's on this list.
You need to talk?
(to Elaine, still joking) He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce!
I really don't eat it.
What's that?
Yeah, he looks busy! Yeah!
Hey, you look awful.
Oh, the "triangle" guy.
Oh, hi Evelyn.
Then it does exist.
They're closing. We're going for one last slice.
Oh, this is awful.
Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?
Yeah, it's pretty good.
The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.
(jocular) You got any kids?
Leo's furious. (He stops in his tracks when he sees Elaine looking at George's book) What is that doing on the table?
So what are you gonna do?
(sarcastically) Oh, yeah.
What do you mean you got caught?
(interrupts) I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going.
Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.
Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It never happened before.
STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) Do you believe this? Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house! He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw.
I'm out.
You know who speaks Korean?
Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?
In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?
Ah..........
So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, hes thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, theres nothing left?
Oh no, not you too?
Yeah, when it's your money, it's fascinating.
So?
No.
Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, "This is good, who is this? I like this person". You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, (pretending to wake up) "Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of here!"
wait, where are you going? where are you going?
What you're suggesting is illegal.
She wants to be back on yours.
What? Why didn't you wake me up?
You know, instead, Im like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.
Hello?
You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?
Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?
So that's here?
So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out (as mortician) 'Here, Mrs Costanza, I thought you might want this'. (as Mrs Costanza, horrified) Aahh!
And who makes the switch?
No!
I didnt even know the woman.
You're not Cartwri-
Columbus, Euro trash.
You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.
What the hell is that?
I don't know what's happening to me.
Oh, sorry.
(imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi... Can't they just send us a tape?
Yeah, this speed-dial's like a relationship barometer.
All right.
Lean your head back. Open your mouth! (Grabs Kramer's head) Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!
George, this is a little too much for me - escaped convicts, fugitive sex...I got a cockfight to focus on. (Jerry leaves.)
Self-esteem?
Cigars!
They sealed him up with the mint inside.
did you say flinty?
He's not doing anything. Goodbye!
The car!
Oh, I get it, this is about the button.
Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?
When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us!
You know, she won an academy award?
So, you think Clyde told him?
Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a back or without.
Eh.
They're making these?
Oh, hello...
By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.
I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going "I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?
How do you account for this?
I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. But I can't anymore.
I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.
You think he's faking?
My car? You drove it into the swamp!
Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read.
You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.
What, What is this? What is she doing here?
For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.
What are you doing here?
Any day that you had gym it was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' "Where's your jock strap?" Ya' know and kids are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History, Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day.
Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?
It's a movie stub from the 930 show. George, I think Willie the dry-cleaner has been wearing my clothes.
I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?
Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.)
I'm gonna get that. (walks across the set towards the blue curtain)
George says hi.
Alright, Newman! This is it! (Shoves him against the wall.)
But that's you.
Don't worry. (she leaves)
(Sarcastic) Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to have them!
All right, Elaine but this is beyond news. This is like Pearl Harbor. Or the Kennedy assassination. It's like not even news. It's total shock.
I'm in show business.
(for the first half of the howl, a dog howls along with him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.
Yeah, and, (Pointing to his watch) because of the.. (Slowly exiting) time.
Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.
No I don't want ?em.
Why?
Hey.
All the time.
I don't know.
He's the pool guy.
(smiles) Actually, I am a comedian.
(frustrated, to self) The whole system is breakin' down!
Under arrest? What for?
He was gonna fire you?
We thought he was with you.
(TO KRAMER, REBOX) Will you let me help you with that?
Oh, excuse me... Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.
They're hands!
Uh, I don't think so.
Oh Diane.
Signed over a hundred checks this morning.
Right here, George. In here. (pointing to his chest) Try opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world.
NBC?
Those damn 'I love you' returns.
Oh my god. This drawer is filled with Fruit Loops!
I don't know, "Hi".
There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.
Woah. (hitting George)
Elaine huh?.. She's completely..
Here. Take a look. What, what is that?
Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.
Oh... all right... wanna get some pizza?
(spits the nut) OooH!!! You. you ate these? You sucked on these and put them on the plate?
Sheriff?........What's with the hat?
Okay, I will.
Alright.
No thanks.
It.
It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today.
(He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.
(Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.
Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes Jody's hand and put it on his shoulder)
Coffee?
yeah, Amber.. I wonder if she's back from Vegas..
It was nice meeting you
Oy.
Ah, I'm so sorry.
You like him?
How did you know I was here?
I'm nuts about her.
Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way.
Yeah.
Why?
Why would I wanna do that?
(putting on his coat to go downstairs, he finds the key in his coat pocket) I believe this belongs to you.
(To Nina) Hey, how 'bout my friend, George? Quite a guy, huh?
She happy for you?
Yeah, Im going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days.
Ah, you know you have a hole in your sneaker there. What is that canvas?
It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
Somebody remember where we parked.
Could you excuse me one second? Im sorry.
(To George, in a 'cha-ching!' motion) Vermont! (To Ellen) With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to! (George is disturbed. He gets up, goes go Kramer's door, and knocks. They talk) Four days at a beautiful bed-and-breakfast! I can't wait.. buy-bye. (Hangs up. George and Kramer come into Jerry's apartment, confronting him) What? (George takes the phone off the hook) What is this?
He what?
Yeah.
(While looking at posters of women wearing glasses) I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.
He did?
Lets talk about that.
Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers are all smudged out. (holds out the ticket and hands it to Bania)
What is that, a 12 gauge?
No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear.
have some more, take some for the road.
And what about that guy asking you out right in front of me?
Yes, but lets just stop it right there.
Hey. (raises hands into fists of encouragement)
Really very nice and good.
Im in heaven.
What d'you mean, breasts?
You're pretty comfortable up there eh, Bubble boy?
Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck.
Where'd you get plans?
Yeah.
Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand.
I'm serious about it.
You don't have to, really.
Alright.
You what?! Get out! (pushes Kramer) Ten thousand?
Well, maybe he doesn't have a "get outta here" kind of personality.
That's a shame.
I really have to go to the bathroom.
I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate.
Yeah, . . . seriously.
You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.
I don't know, some mints or TicTacs.
How do you get all that wood in here?
And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.
Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?
Last week, on Seinfeld.
You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS!
"They get all emotional , they sway. It's embarrassing."
Hey-yah, ho-ah, hey-yah, ho-ah.
Why not?
I'm not sending him to your house.
Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.
A Mister Kenneth Bania.
Never?
C'mon, you lost your wallet, I figured I'd get you another one.
She's the performance artist, right?
Alright.
Nothing.
Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.
Really.
Ah, she kinda calmed down. I talked to her today. In fact I'm gonna see her tonight.
Kramer!? (grabbing Kramer's arm roughly, pulling him back as he's about to knock)
Oh my god, its Joe Divola
So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?
Come on. Something's on your mind. Out with it.
No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.
Hi, I'm Jerry.
Hey.
So she..
"Of course.... But that's got nothing to do with it."
Ah...
I'm going.
That's good stuff.
Hmm. I thought she became a lesbian.
Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a...
Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.
They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.
No, no. It's the valet guy.
All right.
So how did you leave it with him?
What about Puddy?
what's the matter with yours?
But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people.
What are you going to get her?
That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life.( George enters) Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I got.
Well, so what should we do?
And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man.
Hello Newman.
Can I - can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I can't believe this, I make one innocent comment, about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you?
Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble.
I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.
It's at the jeweler.
(to George) You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.
Right above me.
She must be psychotic or something.
Hang on just let me pick up a paper.
He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy. (Mimics brushing his teeth) Away from the gums... (The door opens a little, George jangles the keys to his new car at Jerry and Elaine, then enters.)
Yeah.
Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!
Oh, my God! [takes the phone] Ma?
No, it's...
I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.
He just went in. You know, I think he was wearing my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months.
Ah. But they told us we must go now.
Reer.
That is worse.
Uh huh.
And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.
(Moving to the window, shocked) Oh my God in heaven!
Hello? Oh, hi Stu.
Yeah, too bad.
It was just an innocent comment! I didnt know she had a pony!
OK, wait a second, wait a second, what happened to my papers?
No, what'd you say?
And a dead bolt.
I want that rye lady.
I may have mentioned it.
Aaahhhhh!!
Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.
It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.
It's not here.
I know exactly whats gonna happen tonight. Im gonna try and act like Im not impressed, hes gonna see right through it.
Kramer! (tries to hide he's upset and jealous)
(still watching tv; sounds like basketball) Bottle-wipe supercedes it.
Uma Therman? Really?
I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.
Beats me.
No, that's ok, I really don't need any money.
Yes, it can.
Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere... I got my bags, I'm ready to go.
I'm Vandelay Industries?
Ah, well. Thank you very much!
Ahh, we waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.
Boo!
(acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?
I don't even think you could do it.
Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.
Hello there you are.
Did you give blood?
Hey...
No, but the difference is negligible.
Say Dad, (pointing at a raincoat sitting on the carousel next to an open box) isn't that one of yours?
(reading, unimpressed) Ohh, 'Number 1 Dad'.
All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!
What is that anyway?
Yeah, he's dating a crayon.
Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours.
Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat back. Why don't you just give him the money for the suit?
Are you gonna say it again?
I knew it! I'm not crazy.
You know I dont get that whole suicide machine. Theres no tall buildings where these people live? They cant wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?
Who?
No, really, I just got off the phone with him.
From your mother.
Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)
Yeah, you're right. It's just a natural human function...happens to be on my sofa, instead of in the toilet, where it would normally be.
Not that there's anything wrong with that...
Phone call? Who knows I'm here?
Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!
Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.
Kramer.
Yeah, but John invited her.
Yeah, it's all my father's doing.
This old thing?
Hey, what size suit are you?
You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when you're happy.
George is dating a convict.
He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?
More Pledge! I just bought two cans last week and I don't even have any wood in the house!
Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.)
I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.
(to Kramer) It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand. Wheres she gonna get five thousand? She doesnt have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. Shes gone. Then you come in, Why dont you loan her five thousand? What do you care? Youve got five thousand. Give her five thousand!
Hey, can I have my dollar back?
All right. Calm down.
I notice you threw 'stocky' in there.
Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?
Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. Im sure theyd just as soon give it to you, but youd have to come up with that money.
Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.
Alright. (Approaches host) Excuse me, this is your party, right?
I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep.
Wow! that's incredible......But you don't draw.
Yeah?
"I think so."
I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?
Well I started screaming, "There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina." Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running (In the background -- CLERKS VOICE 57) and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.
Who thinks you're smart?
I thought you were on strike?
Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.
On your knees, Ajax, hands scrubbin', the whole deal?
(apologetically) Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe.
All right. Enjoy"Blame it on the Rain"
Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to agree on anything. Why don't we all just go to Paris?
Lord of the manor.
How was your first day?
Oh why don't you go sleep over at Newman's.
Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said "Too bad he's gay".
Hey, I had nothing to do with it.
Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.
Yeah
Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there.
(continues)Like a shrimp farmer....
Sounds like a really cool fort.
It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him, he makes a "Tada!" gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say "I'll see ya.", and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute)
Yeah...
Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, (has his one hand up and his other hand down) he was down. Now he's up, (switches the positioning of his hands) you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?
Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?
Oh. (smiling) Oh, that's nice of 'em.
Hey! Kramer.
Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.
Yeah, I think I do.
Do I know you?
Yeah.
(cynical) This is the signal? Thank you, Mr. Signal. Where were you yesterday?
What do I say if he picks up?
(to George) He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.
No I haven't vomited in thirteen years.
I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that.
You gotta go to my chiropractor, hes the best.
Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.
No, he just doesn't like me.
Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.
Yeah!
That looks pretty good.
Huh.
What, you rented "Home Alone"?
That's him.
No. No. I was kidding. It's terrible.
It sure is.
Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.
Well uh, whatever you can do. Thanks.
So we go back to my apartment..
You're not going to open with that, are you?
So you put down my money?!
All right, I'll call 911. Think he did it? Could've he done it? Couldn't done it? How could've he done it? Couldn't be? Could it? Hello 911? How are you? I'm sorry it was just a reflex...I know it's an emergency number...it is an emergency...my friend is being accused of being a smog strangler and I know he didn't do it...they're putting me trough to the detective in charge of the investigation...what is my name? Who am I? I'm eh...George Costanza...
Stop the mail?
I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.
Your breath is fine. It's delightful, it's delicious.
Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.
Oh, no...
The washer fluid is fine.
We've been breaking up for 10 hours?
Mr. Marbles?
Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.
Do you have to write all this stuff down.
oh look at that I got oil all over me. Can I have your napkin?
I did it for you.
(standing) Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours. (indicates Buddy) You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track.
(Giving Newman a sour look) I'm just hanging out in this hell-hole because of George.
You sold my Cadillac to Jack Klompus?
Oh, hey Ramon.
Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll *all* be over...
Get out of here!
Don't feel right? What are you talking about?
Thats the bet! (The phone rings; Jerry answers it.) Hello?... No- oh, hi... (Kramer leaves) no, they just left... Oh, my God... hang on a second. Maybe I can still catch em. (Jerry goes over to the window and opens it; calling out the window) Ma! Ma! Up here! Dont get in the cab! Manya died! Manya died!!
So you're okay with everything?
Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? That's like half a pound of turkey!
Yeah, Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R. Uh, I don't know, wavy? George, how would you describe Kramer's hair?
Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in the Immigration Department, they're gonna straighten the whole thing out, the wheels are in motion, things are happening even as we speak!
Hey.
Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my shirt.
Echh
Fifty years they were married. Now hes moving to Pheonix.
Hey Sid, what happened?
So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry?
You did it? What happened?
Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You cant do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over.
Did you say, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show" or, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show"? (Elaine comes over.)
I don't doubt it.
When did you get that?
So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, I gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didn't?
You seemed a little mad.
Yeah.
Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me...
I told you.
Aaah...
Then can I have it back?
Let me tell you something Babu. You go back in that kitchen -- tell your chef I want the works.
Toilet paper?
Who told you about Martin?
Thanks, because I would really like... (distractedly puts coffee cup back on the table)
What was I supposed to do? You knew I was on my first date with Elaine. You come barging in here asking me to contribute money for a volcano relief fund for krakatoa.
No. (Lanette leaves.) Did you at least pick them up?
Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.
Make sure you get this area here, where he needs the help....
Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer. (Kramer enters)
(to Ramon) Oh. Okay. (to Elaine) Wh, what is he doing here?
All right, let me ask you this when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot?
Well I don't know if I ...
Alright, well. Just, start again, then.
(to George) It was a wonderful reading.
Really? I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women.
Well, said he was waiting about two hours. Seemed a little put out.
Right. For the reducing of the pond scum?
Fire drill, can you believe that?
Well, I have some money. What do you need? (pulls out some bills)
By Elaine Benes?
What?
Wow.That's hot.
Wow. Kenny Rogers Roasters. Finally open. Hey, look at the size of that neon chicken on the roof.
When George was growing up..
I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.
Irish, Scottish, whats the difference, lassie?
Whos he?
Oh, hi Rita.
I never really wanted the pen.
Can't you shut the shades?
You're making a big mistake, Joe!
My Nana?
Completely naked?
You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut.
Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series.
(impatient) Gone! (starts maniacally laughing) (briefly stops to point and explain) That bumper sticker.
1409, that's a good score.
Yeah.
Hey Joe! HOW YOU DOING?
What does that mean, good dip?
Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.
What about my "questionable material"?
You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off.
So you think it's a non-vite?
No, no this woman is different , she's incredible. she's just like me. She talks like me, she acts like me. She even ordered cereal at a restaurant. We even have the same initials. Wait a minute, I just realised what's going on.
What?
No steam!
All right, fine. Get the soup!
You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won!
Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana.
So when somebody has B.O., the "O" usually stays with the "B". Once the "B" leaves, the "O" goes with it.
I look about the same.
What did you say then?
Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!
Ohhhhh.. John-John.
Excuse me?
I don't think so.
What about this? This is blood isn't it?!
We'll get a ride.
You're cold?
Also with her hands.
I'm going to the hospital, to visit Fulton.
We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us.
What? Leave? Where? Why?
To Latvian Orthodox?
Yeah, that was me.
(thinking) This is brutal.
Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.
Well.
Kramer.
Oh, hi Gennice.
(thoughtful) Hmm, that could hurt me. (pointing out of window) Hey, there it is.
Hi, Dolores. George, you remember Dolores?
George! Can we focus on the car, here?
Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something.
If you'll excuse me.
Nooo.
(sarcasm) Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower.
You know, I think I'll just take the check.
So, how did you meet him?
Where?
Take the K-man.
I don't mind at all. Why should I mind? What did he say?
How could you not?
Hey.
Okay, take it.
I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.
I dont know. He said hed call back.
Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!
Aww...
Wow. The enthusiastic hi. Thats beautiful.
I think I'm in love.
I do.
Well put something down, youre taking twenty minutes on this. So is Uncle Mac and Artie, theyre all coming over here before the wedding?
Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.
Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
(To himself) Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over there? It's not like somebody died. It's "Beaches" for god's sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't.
No. This is why you're not in the pilot.
(naked, carrying a belt sander) I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here.
Ill call him. (Jerry picks up the cordless phone. He points to the rotary phone on the coffee table. Kramer, George, and Elaine struggle for it.) Hello, Ray?... Hi, Ray, this is Ravas friend, Elaines friend, Jerry... The King of Comedy, right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? (He covers the reciever and yells at Kramer and George.) Would you shut up?! (to the phone) Yeah, you dont want to talk about it over the phone?.. You dont want Rava to hear?... Yeah, I understand... You know that coffee shop near my house, Monks?... All right, tomorrow... One o clock... Great, okay, bye.
Hey, Steve. How you doing?
It's ludicrous..
Ugh, the four worst words in the English language.
Having her in jail.
Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my jacket.
Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.
What happened to you?
All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital.
Me.
Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal--
Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?
Hello Newman.
We'll call him...
Hi.
Kramer, they're fumigating. There's toxic gas in there.
Yes you did.
Nice looking fellow.
He'll be here any second.
I was ready to get jiggy with it.
Alright.
I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.
Got lost? We went to school here for three years.
Where you goin'?
Look Ramon, you're, you're a nice guy. But I, I actually only have three friends. I really can't handle any more.
I mean, ... if you want to.
It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.
I dont know.. fifteen hundred dollars.
different for a man
Hi.
How did it happen?
Oh, cmon! Its down again?!
Yeah.
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me.
I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce you get impeached and you're not even the president!
Would you take a drink and let us smell you?
Happy, Pappy? What does that mean?
I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.
They'll give us water in there.
It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday.
What? The physical therapist? Why?
I know, but...
Goodnight. (They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.)
Are you sure?
You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 950, I'm not gonna be able to make it!
(thinking) Well, the drive home should be a delight. Im speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I dont care. (to Vanessa) That's the manager? Do you want me to see if we can get another room?
You know I'm paying for these tickets.
Where you goin'?
Well, what d'you think the hoboes are doing?
Who?
Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!
(arriving at apartment, sees Phil start to open his apartment door, only one door down from Kramer's) So you live right... there.
I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?
(on the phone) Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.
You wanna barrow Golden Boy!
(unenthusiastic) Oh, the gum.
Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out.
I cant believe I do.
All right, I think we've covered my act. Now you get out there and stink it up with everybody else.
Good!
Who's gonna be O'Brien?
You're not qualified to work at the catalog.
I was saying 'baby' way before George!
George.
Come again?
Why *is* that?
Oh!! Let me ask you a question. Was the movie part of the bet?
Of course I can, am I being funny now?
What?
So you're enjoying the not enjoying.
See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'.
This is some FINE mutton.
Hi.
Not good
Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.
She's fifty.
Hello Leo. You don't have to yell.
(answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back.
Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.
I don't need a personal trainer. (Kramer comes in) all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later.
Please don't crouch.
Good.
Oh yeah right.
Bad.
(Into phone) How do you figure? (To Kramer) 'Cause you're the one who left the door open.
(surprise) You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building too?
Friday night? Nothin', ... now.
I...am not taking it.
No,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld is the devil.
Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.
Yeah, what happened?
No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a van guy.
Good.
Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?
Ma.
Hi.
No, I believe it's next week.
So, could I...
Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps?
You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your speed-dial.
(on phone) hello.
Is he smart?
hey
You werent?
(picks up the headphones) That was Elaine...
"Sometimes I tuck'em sometimes I don't"
Couldn't be the guy...nah.
Turn in?
How're things going?
I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?
Take it.
Kramer!
I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you.
...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss hello thing anymore. (continues backing away) I'm sorry. I just can't do it. It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm sorry.
Y'know I hear that all the time.
George Peppard has been dead for years.
Yeah. And she picked the day!
You swear?
Sure.
Should I shake his hand?
Bye bye
If you can.
I don't have your suit. I gave it away.
Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off that sign?
At the zoo?
Nah. It's not good for friends to talk about money, it can affect the friendship.
What are you doing here?
(jocular) Eighteen-fifties?
Oh, can Lloyd really do that?
(hearing Newman turns and sees him) Hiya Newman.
Sure, its like robbing a bank. You dont loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.
No, I read in the paper..
Bit you?!
And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
You don't think she's just talking to me?
If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened.
So what now?
So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth? (Elaine laughs silently)
It's funny.
(Arms out, complaining) I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak!
You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and sit in it.
Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on.
No. Not Chinese. Not even Asian.
What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.
You dont know Robert Schumann? The composer?
Beth and Arnie broke up.
Slim-fit?
Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup.
Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon.
So you like her?
Are you insane? Give 'em to me.
I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.
So, what are you doing this weekend?
Sex, thats meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; thats heavy. Thats like an hour.
Other drivers?
This is Nikki.
Sure.
You're not very bright, are you?
Really? (sits on couch)
Well not technically.
Just relax, you'll be fine.
Biff?
You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're Mae West? Of course he's gonna try and get you alone for the weekend.
Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving? There's no grace period.
No no no, dont interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what its doing. Just let it finish.
Hmmmm...
Enough chatting, let's play.
Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally, yeah this is Jerry,I just wanted to leave you a message that I caught your little piece on TV and..
Dad!
You tried.
Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?
Who?
Too sexual.
Why?
Marine biology.
Mom, you too?
Already?
No.
Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles...
Oh, you want to try the syrup! (Meryl smiles and takes it. The waitress comes over.)
Oh, what about 'ladies night'? Women admitted free before 10?
What are you talking about?
What writer? It's a sitcom.
I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!
Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?
Nah!
Yeah, so?
Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.
Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.
Oh yea, I didn't even realize.
Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?
Right above me.
So you go in the bathroom at eleven your in bed by what, two?
Kramer won't sell.
I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.
You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.
I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little acting scenes.
I dunno. Hard to say.
Seth?
What's wrong?
That was a one in a million Mohel.
Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited.
(animated) They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!
Hi Elaine.
More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.
Elaine is having a "houseguest." She's picking him up at the airport tonight.
(into the phone, with a disguised voice) So, what's going on?
No, Im fine.
(Pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more immaturity by holding it up, smiling) Hey! A dinosaur!
I'm a good printer.
Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad.
She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing to George) He likes the pop-in, too.
Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?
We used to come in every day.
I don't know.
Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me.
I want the massage!
Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket books. Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers.
You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had my chance and that's that.
Hey look ,you know, you're the one who's locked out. I'm letting you stay here. You're wearing my bathrobe. You should adapt to me.
It's okayit's just a hot dog, (still sobbing) everything is going to be okay.
(Sarcastically) Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.
No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes to the station.
Am not.
Uh Laura, George was wondering if...
I came to pick you up.
Statute.
Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.
I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.
Ah.
Are we going out?
For what?
All right Thanks. Come on lets go
Really? What happened?
And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.
Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car.
No.
Well you should hear the message from my nut. Where's George and Kramer, I want to get inside already, I don't like standing out here, I feel very vulnerable.
What?
Is she nice?
Oh! Come on, you told them you're from out-of-town just so you could stay in a hotel room.
Can you get vomit out of suede?
C'mon up. (turns to George) You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.
That bothered you?
Come on, its just down the hall.
The dating world is not a fun world...its a pressure world, its a world of tension, its a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I dont know what they need. I know I dont have it, I know that- You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one Im- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, were all human beings, what is the story? Ive never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, Ive never been in a situation, when I thought to myself I could use a cotton-ball right now. I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they dont need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, theyre like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? Theyre huge and two days later, theyre out, theyre gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin with them? The only time I ever see em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, theres two or three, that look like theyve been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I dont know what happened to them. I once went out with a girl whos left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over at my house. I dont know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. Lets move on. The dating world is a world of pressure. Lets face it a date is a job interview that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance youll end up naked at the end of it. You know? Well, Bill, the boss thinks youre the man for the position, why dont you strip down and meet some of the people youll be workin with?
Number one?
I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!
Yeah.
He lives in a bubble.
Then what was it?
So...?
Valerie's not coming over, is she?
It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman.
(to the phone) Oh, its you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldnt have had to do this. Now thats two long distance calls I made to you why cant you... (The guy hangs up on Jerry again; to nobody) Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much.
Well , as I said this type of thing is very common in show business
From my house. I got a whole box of them.
Oh, I had that comin' to me.
I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me.
Come on in here.
Like you care.
"I dunno how you could forget . He kept reffering to himself in the third person. "Jimmy's under the boards. Jimmy's in the open. Jimmy makes the shot."
Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?
All right.
Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!
Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
She saved your life?
Fine.
Then that's the meal.
Well, guess I'll get going.
I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight.
Below the equator?
Elaine ... look! A twenty!
What if it's Neil Diamond?
What happened?
Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.
(Kramer shows Jerry and Elaine the paper) "Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research".." Government funds genetic research at area hospital" ... Yeah, so?
That's not a good role for you.
Really?
Who are you?
Hi.
Hello. Oh, hi mom. (listens) What? Oh my... He didn't?! He couldn't! (listens) Alright, I will. (listens) Okay, bye.
Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila.
Yeah, the guy with the flat head.
It is not!
What did you say to her?
(startled - eyes wide open) Hello, is somebody there? (scurrying sound) Mr.- Mr. Marbles?
All right.
You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough...
Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations.
How's the...sexual chemistry?
What's the matter? What's going on?
We need you there!
Oh, she worked at Doubleday...?
I'm not in the mood.
(George enters) Oh, why you havin' a party?
I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in the car!
Where are you going?
Thanks, Julio.
What?
Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.
How many session did my parents paid for?
Almost.
How could I have done that?
What causes homophobia? What is it, that makes a heterosexual man, worry? I think it's because, men know, that deep down we have weak sales resistance. We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. Men think, "Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'"
........For spite...
Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital.
No, I guess shes still mad.
Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't.
(defensive) No no, that's not true!
...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it. I'm sorry.
What are we gonna do?
Oh, you don't know.
What did I do?
So, that's your poker face.
You want to go with me to NBC?
Yeah
A matron?
Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me.
Well, maybe it's a good thing.
So we'll talk about the hooks then?
So what'd you think?
Poppie!
Where have you been?!?
No Kramer, Little Jerry could get hurt.
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Awe... That's nice!
Ate? What? What the hell are you talking about? Now you listen to me, you get out of that apartment this instant. If you screw this up for me I swear....
(Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah?
Do I have to ask?
Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)
Yeah, so?
Gina, do you know what a Drakes Coffee Cake is?
Let me rephra-
Its too far.
With Jon Voight's teeth marks. (Looks at the owner's manual.) Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.
It tastes like dirt.
Raymond?
That's incredible!
You're on fire today.
He took out Kruger?
Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.
I cant believe what Im hearing.
What guys?
Well, what do you think the big holdup is?
Good question. (More to himself than to Elaine) Why are we calling?
Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.
ALL RIGHT, all right! I'll call her.
Oh! I think we're at the bottom.
Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'
But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity.
Just put it.
I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
All right. (picks up the alarm clock) Let's check out the clock. Notch good... 650... volume check. (music playing, he starts swinging) What kinda music you wanna wake up to? Top 40, classical...
Did you at least get him a card?
(not amused) Very funny.
Well, let's start the insanity.
She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman.
I went to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of the urinal. So(throws away belt) thats it!
So, you two been, uh..
Keys?!
This is quite a condo.
You taking Allison?
Oh, hey. You got in.
Double zero?
(Scoffing) Camp.
(looking shocked) Really? When?
I... don't... know...
c'mon ,c'mon....
It's a nervous tic. I'm on L-Dopa.
That's right. I bought it.
I don't know. They're, backed up.
Don't get smart.
Hear that? Guess who's back. (Opening the door) Hey!
But I need the home bed advantage.
Four hundred a month.
Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!
Artsy?
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity?
What about you, George?
See ya.
I never remember you with a girl.
Yeah.
Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.
So it's over?
[quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's directed at *me*, isn't it?!
I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
(Following Leo out the door) Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!
DIDN'T YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE?
That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!
He's invulnerable to creditors.
That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. (goes knocking on Kramer's)
Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, its with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I mightve been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge.
Actually it's being taken care of right now.
I don't even know what you're talking about.
Ill tell you later.
They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.
Convulsing?
Who?
But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.
(On the phone) George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.
You wanna know? Come on outside.
I understand.
Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.
It's a mammal.
Nooo.
But you yada yada'd over the best part.
To a guy you've never met? (mild sarcasm) Your screening process is getting ever more rigorous.
He doesn't work here anymore.
Well you have insurance...
What's the expiration date on that?
Oh, it's a scene.
Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back)
It's not going to happen.
Vanessa, thank you. Ive been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.
Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!
(walking over the the buzzer to answer it) Oh, that's the Flicks.
Strange. Even not showing up at the taping...
Oooh.
All right.. Go ahead.
(animated) You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money. I just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I...
Sure. Bye.
..What about the Van Wyck?
Have I ever been less than forthright?
What are you talking about?
Well, I did the best I could.
Nope. You?
What did you do?
Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead.
Hey George.
We come from the same place.
Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.
It was funny!
Jerry.
Reading for the Blind?
Really? I'll have to remember that.
You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.
Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come on.
Well, maybe she was disconnected.
I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine!
(a lightbulb goes on in his head) Riverside Drive.
Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N?
What kind of pie are you cooking?
I cant get involved in this.
Shes waking down the street and it hit her in the head!
No, I'm calling her.
Hm, really?
It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
Ah, it's probably like Smith over there.
Hey.
Alright, I'll see you Thursday night, right?
Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and tear.
Yeah, all right. All right.
[indignantly] What's the matter with you?
I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.
Who are you?
We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.
Giddee up!
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over.
Nightmares. You?
Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the etiquette?
The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, its a meal.
Have you said anything to her about it?
Hey, Kramer...?
Its never happened to me before.
(Getting a dollar out) Wheres your money?
So, its okay? I could just tell her she can have it?
Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift. I know, it's a label maker. The Label Baby Junior. Yeah, I hear they're good. Well, label me thankful. Okay, well you enjoy those tickets. Buh-bye.
Thats not too bad. Its not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.
Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course.
Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.
No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close.
Alright, but let me ask you this question.
Are you sure you can't stay longer?
All right, all right. (trying on the suit jacket)
They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.
He knows what he's doing.
What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. That was a cool one.
(bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.
Maybe this isn't my coat.
What the hell is a plantain.
okay , bye (to George) What happened , did you take it off?
Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back.
Okay, how about this I'm in my apartment, you come in.
(as Kramer walks by) You're a master of race relations.
Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*.
I don't understand why we have to eat now.
My pants!
Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.
Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese. (buys a newspaper out of a machine)
Yeah, yeah.
Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes.
I don't know. 25 bucks a day.
Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.
George, you need a medical doctor.
Kramer, it is not what you think.
Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.
Okay. (shuts mouth)
Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!
Well don't get too comfortable. As soon as Seth gets a real job you two are gong back in that chicken supernova.
(Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) He'll probably kill his family over this.
Have we even been in public?
Why are you doing this?
Why are you looking at my face?
What happened?
Ok, I'll see ya.
I'm I'm a comedian.
This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.
(doubtful) You were in the Army?
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...
Really?
Hey
(sings theme) "By Mennen."  What the?...
After two dates!
From what?
Too good.
Am I going? It was three nights ago.
Oh, hi.
You don't want to go with me?
Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever it is. (vehement) Just take it!
Yeah.
No it's true. This woman saved my life. I was crossing the street .I was almost hit by a car...and then we talked and.......the whole thing just seemed like a dream.
Yeah well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.
Hey.
What's the matter?
"Well...........you know....."
I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different... sources.
Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?
Why didn't you pull over?
Hello Newman.
Oh, it's a scene man.
What's the kid doing here?
He's got like a chemical imbalance. He needs to be on medication.
(To Elaine) Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute.
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..
No, Kramer, I don't want you to say anything to him.
Why?
How much is it?
Well, what d'you think?
You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
So what are you gonna do?
Uh, hang on a second, You know what? Changed my mind, make it a tuck.
I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.
Nancy Klopper?
What?
It's true.
All I said was I liked the pen!
Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.
Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery.
alright that's enough
I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that?s more you're thing.
I guess.
Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.
Well there's spaces there, they must drive!
I think he's the same age as the father.
So then what?
No.
I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.
Well, so what's the difference?
If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen.
Huh?
Hm.
Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.
That's it, you gave up?
So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. Its a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and Im supposed to feel bad. Is that the way its supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldnt you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. Cause its not easy to give someone the toe, youve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and... (Jerry pretends to drive with one foot in the air, giving the toe.) Look at that toe, buddy. (He puts his foot down.) I mean, thats really insulting to get the toe, isnt it?
Hey, Jeff. What's happening?
Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Alright, I'll see you.
I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.
Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal.
(to Kramer) Who is it?
George Costanza...
Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.
I dont think you did anything wrong.
Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding.
(Disappointed) Oh. Is George there?
Look, let me just give you the forty, plus another twenty for your trouble.
A little.
Then YOU would be hunched over.
Its wonderful.
It was a gift.
What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?
Coughing... naked... It's a turn-off, man.
How ya doing?
I don't think so...
Whats that one?
But you took a nap in it.
It's this one here in the back. (Tilts his head back, and knocks Elaine's trophy out the window. A loud hissing sound and commotion is heard from the street below. Everyone runs to the windows to look.)
How come? I told you - It's fantastic.
Yeah! It's a doodle.
Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.
World's collide. (points at George)
What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it.
Ah, Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
That was our babka. We had that babka!
(Showing that it's a problem) Leo, I saw you steal.
You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?
Aaaahhh...!!!
George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!
Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?
I will show you The Stooges.

Uh huh... Yeah... Okay, thanks anyway... Bye.

He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me anything.
Yeah, sure. My parents will be there.
