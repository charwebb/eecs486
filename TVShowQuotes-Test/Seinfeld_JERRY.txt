Well, once I didnt have dinner until, like 900 oclock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage  meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya? Throw out my garbage for me.
Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game.
Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?
Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.
So how did you leave it with him?
(pulling on a jacket) They had a cancellation and they instantly called me.
(having an idea) I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.
What about this? This is blood isn't it?!
Oh right, the new job, how is it?
Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please.
What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?
What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave them to me, how many time I gotta thank him?
Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too.
I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood.
I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?
Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?
So what did you do there all day?
(Sarcastically) Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.
I know it's a big problem.. she puts like four pieces in her mouth, it's ridiculous, I don't think we're gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.)
On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?
It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.
Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.
Oh, nothing really, just a homicide. [She finds the right spot on his back] Oh that's terrific... Mulva.
Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.
Yeah... Because they would be very demanding people.
No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.
(grabbing the list from Kramer) You're not getting any plantains.
I was ready to get jiggy with it.
I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.
That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. (goes knocking on Kramer's)
I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.
Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.
No appointments at all? (motions to Elaine to move over)
I don't have your suit. I gave it away.
A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name?
Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat back. Why don't you just give him the money for the suit?
Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!
The captain of the toes. (phone rings) Hello.
Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?
Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?
We're in the middle of a discussion here.
Not that I would think of doing such things.
What? After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never say it again.
Which part? The renovating the restaurant you dont own part or spending the two hundred million you dont have part?
Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-
Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding) Not just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door, he waves)
Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?
No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.
You can say what you want about me but Ill be damned if Im going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.
Alright, then just get rid of it. You wont have any problem.
(Following Leo out the door) Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!
Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking.
. Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it
Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews.
He yells and you don't get your soup.
Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight)
The swedish are very big massagers. You know? They like the swedish meatballs, swedish massage. They like having meat in their hands these people, for some reason. But it's weird because they have the highest suicide rate, they're rubbing each other's necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. I don't really like the idea of getting a professional massage. I don't want people touching me that don't know me and don't want to have sex with me. You know what are you bothering me for? You get me all loosened up, juices flowing, and then that's it ok, you're done. It's like having chocolate rubbed all over your face, you know you wanna go "Excuse me, I think you missed a spot."
All right, all right. Whats the big hubbub, bub?
Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.
I think I may have made a big mistake.
Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?
Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either.
On your knees, Ajax, hands scrubbin', the whole deal?
Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.
(in the hallway, hearing the door lock behind him, turns back) Kramer!
Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!
What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of temperament?
Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?
(thinking) Thank you, Pamela! (turns to talk to Vanessa; to Vanessa) So, youre a lawyer...
We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)
For crying out loud, He's Superman. (Fulton stops laughing, Jerry's face is stunned) Fulton? (looks at him) Fulton?
Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours.
It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.
Actually, yeah. (Pause) Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?! (Dramatically) Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?!
I know, and then you say to yourself, From this moment on, Im not gonna waste any more of it. But then you go, How? What can I do thats not wasting it?
I was kind of um (pauses) making out.
My car? You drove it into the swamp!
No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o.
Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.
Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a job.
(to the phone) Oh, its you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldnt have had to do this. Now thats two long distance calls I made to you why cant you... (The guy hangs up on Jerry again; to nobody) Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much.
Well, I am sure I had a good reason.
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.
NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.
Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...
No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg creams) You gotta put the syrup in first.
I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over.
So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.
Oh, shes really great. I mean, shes got like a real warmth about her and shes really bright and really pretty and uh... the conversation though, I mean, it was... talking with her is like talking with you, but, you know, obviously much better.
That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?
Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!
Yeah, yeah, take care of it. (Jerry throws her some toilet paper) Come on, George, what is it?
Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain?
No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!
how can u say things like that over the phone?
I think we might have one left in the stock room.
No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.
Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.
(on phone) But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that?s not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what?s the difference, I?m a comedian of the United States, and I?ll tell you I?m under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye.
Well, it couldnt be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?
Im supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?
Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..
I want this baby fully loaded. (listens) Well, how soon can you get it there? (listens) Oh, that's terrific. (listens) Okay, thanks, bye.
(pause) So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?
And what about yooou?!? Tryin' to bilk an innocent bystander out of a family fortune, built on sweat and toil, manufacturing quality O'Henry candy bars, for honest, hard-working Americans!
(pointing at Georges shirt) See, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. Its too high! Its in no-mans-land. You look like you live with your mother.
We'll see about that. (Runs to the window and shouts up to Kramer, who's on the roof.) Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight to win!
Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?
Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers are all smudged out. (holds out the ticket and hands it to Bania)
Well I, if it's your day off I really... (tries to leave)
hunky.. Tony.. hey hey hey (fools around with his collar again)
Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her.
So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?
They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?
Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,
Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!
You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out events.
I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this
Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah.
It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back.
It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that?
Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you.
"I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite."
Religion, my friend, thats what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that its going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs.
(Looking at his notebook) Alright, I got, uh, you come in, you say "Hi", and I say "Hello".
This has 'international incident' written all over it.
Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.
Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.
The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!
(Sarcastic) Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.
(holding up a piece of paper) I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.
(Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery.
But I don't know if this is gonna work.
So then as I was getting out of the car, ...
Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?
You do of course try on, when you buy?
Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.
This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.
They guy's in my house right now. What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone.
Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid ,stupid...
Look at you, youre still thinking about it. Ill never feel comfortable.
First of all, I made plans with Elaine.
All right, forget it, forget it. Im not taking the place!
You what?! Get out! (pushes Kramer) Ten thousand?
They sealed him up with the mint inside.
A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.
It has nothing to do with her sister.
He could have said "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.
But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.
No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.
What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?
Yeah I got it. You sure you want to do this? (hands Elaine the tape recorder.)
You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.
Whats brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guyll be like, I dont think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life? And of course the womans looking at the guy, thinking, What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?
Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office doing this? (moves his arm) He's gonna think you're a mental patient.
Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.
No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?
What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present)
Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?
And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her?
No. (Lanette leaves.) Did you at least pick them up?
Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.
Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great?
But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke.
Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp.
Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.
So you were talking, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") you're having pleasant conversation, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") then all of sudden...
(aside, to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?
You know, what you need is a song you can share.
Expecting Newman? That's funny because I just happened upon him down at the Kenny Roger's Roasters.
"I don't know how you can eat that spicy chicken,"
I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.
How 'bout if it was something like " I can't find my receipt my place's a stye.
(tucking in his shirt) Oh ya this is Rachel.
You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!
What do you mean? Why wouldn't I know his name?
You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink.
You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really... interesting. He would-
He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over.
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second. ! Celebrate! How about some champagne?
When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.
I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.
Don't look at him. (Phil starts to knock on the door)
Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up) Since I said what?
I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.
You can't go to China What about your job?
Oh, Im sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine.
All right George, c'mon, what d'you got? (sits opposite George)
Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you.
Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?
Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.
Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores.
Elaine, have you noticed George was acting strange the whole flight?
Kramer, why do you have to (noticing Newman) Hello, Newman.
Well, for one think, don't listen to him.
Yes I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's condition...
I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! (Intercom buzzes. He answers it) Yeah?!
The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.
So I finally get to meet your pal Joey.
What, do you think I care about the money? Is that what you think? You want me to show you what I care about money? Here look, here look at this, here's a dollar here look, there, that?s how much I care about money.
So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.
He feels funny. You don't have to do this.
Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He planned the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal.
Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!
Y'know, I think I'll pass on the "Guys And Dolls"...
It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. It got to me. And that orgasm stuff orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure!
(Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.
I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?
I mean that's fine if that's who you are...
(accusingly) Hey, this is the zee page of my address book.
Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?
(to Kramer) So how's your karate class going?
Yeah, but how could you be so sure?
I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?
(throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care?
Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata?
The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.
(outraged) He's a doctor!.I mean it's supposed to be like a sterile environment."
Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the hell out of there.
Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...
No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.
Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Uh, gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. Alright let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... (looks at Joe; Joe gives him a weird look)ooo, just right... and three plantains uh ought to do it.
Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so well and I told him he should make it into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? So, you uh, going with me to the auto show with me Saturday?
Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?
Ah, dinner! Thats it, youre all the way back!
Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.
W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it.
Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.
Just go back and ask him again. (Slams the door on Kramer)
I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin else.
George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?
Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.
I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV Guide.
(gets up) No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why dont you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin anything?
Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?
(still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.
That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.
No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.
I don't know. Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers.
Hey, remember Beth and David from yesterday? They got separated.
I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.
You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?
I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this.
(looking at Kramer's moustache) Uh, we're not doing that anymore.
Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivian's.
It's a cigar store Indian. (to Elaine) Read the card.
Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, "Why knock my brains out?"
All right Newman, one more peep outta you, you're out of the whole operation!
No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant.
I can't believe your a friend of mine.
(arriving at apartment, sees Phil start to open his apartment door, only one door down from Kramer's) So you live right... there.
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.
(scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.
Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.
So what do you have to say for yourself?
Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)
Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!
He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about "Jerry."
Im just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure.
(to George) I mean, come on. (a thought occurs) No, the stupidest thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is the same guy from *Seals and Croft*.
Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.)
In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.
She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?
What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?
Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.
I never shouldve gotten involved in this. Im a nervous wreck. Im not cut out for investing.
Nobody can be in here for 48 hours, I got my parents in town.
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.
It is! (Jerry walks forcefully into the dressing room and closes the door) Give me that back.
Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.
He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck!
oh look at that I got oil all over me. Can I have your napkin?
Blow it off. Remember Poli Sci? How many of those did we go to?
I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. The woman is absolutely mesmerizing.
...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Lemme tell you something if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. You're not going to be needing those for awhile, either.
It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse "ha's." You know those?
The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.)
Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story.
(Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic?
Well, you want your organizer back don't you?
First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.
(pause, to Donna) You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name...
Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?
Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.
So go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.
I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!
I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night only, the big screen. My hands are tied!
Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania?
Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The whole thingreal bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though.
Im getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other line beeps) Im getting another call, see ya(answers call) Hello!
Well, we've got to do something. (grabs his phone) I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.
Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right baby-doll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.
You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars.
Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?
So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?
Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!
You don't think she's just talking to me?
Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?
Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.
I can't believe she threw out my napkin.
So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. Its a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and Im supposed to feel bad. Is that the way its supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldnt you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. Cause its not easy to give someone the toe, youve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and... (Jerry pretends to drive with one foot in the air, giving the toe.) Look at that toe, buddy. (He puts his foot down.) I mean, thats really insulting to get the toe, isnt it?
No. I think it's Demi. (the "i" sounds like an "e")
No no come on really, get another one. Itll take a second.
You told Testikov, (Elaine nods) that Tolstoy wanted to name his book "War-- What Is IT Good For?"?
She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over.
For some time... (video of Elaine dancing on the street with Jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.
Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really.
But the question is, are you still master of your domain?
Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, a common ingredient in metal cleaners.
Yeah have a couple of pieces, weak, weak gum yeah
Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children.
I'm not worried about their best pitching. They got pitching. ...They got no hitting.
Who was in town on a business venture, and um..
There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.
You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor story??
Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome.
George used up all my guest passes already.
Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?
Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there.
And I don't want you to hold mine!
Now he's a character. (Pause) So everybody I know is a character on the show.
What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?
Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with here.
And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.
Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right!
So, are you gonna go out with her?
(To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?
No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute.
Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll pick her up on something.
Yeah, I know she's mad at me, but I really have to speak with her.
(looking behind the counter) Hey, is that Babu? It is! (walking over) Hey, Babu!
Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours. (And with that, Jerry made the most fatal mistake of his life)
I could tell you what I did, but you wouldnt believe it. Its not believable.
Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.
Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet.
Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...
No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?
Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it.
Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?
(to George) Snow. Snow, that cant be good for suede, can it?
Well, it was the best of those movies.
I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.
Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?
Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?
Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too.
Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.
No, no, no, it's... "She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her."
Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.
I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.
(smugly, under-his-breath) Not only that, I broke his thumbs.
Well be sure to catch a Broadway show while you're in town.
Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you. There are movie shows...'
You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.
Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?
How you gonna pay? You don't even have a wallet!
Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you dont have to be home on time.
The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.
Oh that's George. (presses the intercom button) Yeah?
Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.
You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.
Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle?
(to Elaine) Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?
Yeah. Specifically 930 shows. Seen any good 930 shows at the Paragon, Willie?
What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out.
After one date you try and improvise on her machine?
(doubtful) I don't know, do you have a--
(Opens the door) C'mon, you wanna go for a ride? (Starts jiggling his keys - as if he's calling out for a dog) Huh? C'mon! C'mon!
(pointing to Kramer's hair) You got some suds over here.
Have you said anything to her about it?
So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him mouth-to-mouth.
Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.
Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!
We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, they're up there going, hey maybe we should give those two guys, who have no experience and no idea, more money!?
Great, its yours. I can't stand the sight of it. Elaine, heres the car keys. (tosses her the keys)
I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.
...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss hello thing anymore. (continues backing away) I'm sorry. I just can't do it. It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm sorry.
'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately.'
A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?
That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.
I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!
Here he is... that's the guy! (rolls up window) No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back!
Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog?
Yeah, so she and "Triangle Boy" can go out to fancy restaurants. (takes a sip of water)
(To Elaine) Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute.
That was a one in a million Mohel.
Yes they *eat* them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!
Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?
Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.
(to himself) I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles. (answers phone) Hello.
Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it.
Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?
I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? (Kramer comes in) A real dermatologist.
So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?
So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise?
NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye.
Well, I'm no genius but, according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.
Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.
(into phone) Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit!
Well, ah w-what do you recommend my good fellow?
(Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?!
(Getting up to answer the door) Alright, did you get that line?
Shes right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, Im gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.
Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?
. . . All right (gritting teeth) Just give me the ticket.
How about we leave and, come back in a week?
Do you know what this is all about? Do you know, why were here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about We should go out? This is what theyre talking about...this whole thing, were all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, were all out! There are people tryin to find us, they dont know where we are. (on an imaginary phone) Did you ring?, I cant find him. Where did he go? He didnt tell me where he was going. He must have gone out. You wanna go out you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...Then youre standing around, whatta you do? You go We gotta be getting back. Once youre out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, its my feeling, youve gotta go.
Of course I can, am I being funny now?
All right lets go. We'll meet you back down here in ten minutes, hopefully with the money.
No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.
Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why dont we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. (All three sit down) Now, look, you both find each other attractive, right?
Let me tell you something Babu. You go back in that kitchen -- tell your chef I want the works.
Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!
You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?
Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.
How much money is this gonna cost me?
I don't know. What if I get caught?
If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.
He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly . I would like to have a good show.
All right. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in principle Arbys no more than once a month. And in exchange, Elaine comes to your softball game, and doesnt read a book.
What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.
I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.
You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.
The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. (he leaves)
Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.
No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!
Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?
Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong.
[mockingly] "Please hurry". Look at you. Look at what you've become.
Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.
Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.
By the way, did you see this? (Hands George a magazine)
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me.
I don't know, opera, it?s not my kind of thing.
You're gonna keep these here for eight months?!
Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.
With Jon Voight's teeth marks. (Looks at the owner's manual.) Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.
Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one!
Im Dan. Can I have my list back, please?
You know, Kramer's gonna clean up on this place.
I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.
(While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!
Elaine, you cannot judge a person on a situation like that. I mean it's like asking for someone's canteen in the desert
Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.
Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?
(still not happy) Uh, alright. (he takes a piece)
I think theres a mental hospital near here.
So get this we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.
Because it's a stupid thing to be called.
Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?
Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and Kramer) Well, I think we proven who the psycho is.
(looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.
That puddle! (Kramer sees the puddle and does a double-take.)
You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world.
Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?
all right lets be reasonable, Bania. Im taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think it's a pretty good deal.
Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon.
I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.
Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble.
I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.
Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.
No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room.
Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.
You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.
I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.
A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!
You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had my chance and that's that.
Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.
Good. And Ill tell you what... You dont have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.
George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.
All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He presents the bottle of fungicide.)
(apologetically) Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe.
(picks up phone) Hello? (listens) Oh, hi Mr. Pitt.
Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again? (listens) Oh really? Well you can't break up with me over the phone. C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me. (hurriedly) Why d'you wear the same dress all the time? Hello.
Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy.
And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.
I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?
Right in front of me!. How do you know we're not together. Two guys, sittin' laughin' drinking Champagne Coolies.
All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.
Yknow what? This is not that bad an idea.
Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.
Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.
What? (Kramer hands Jerry an envelope) My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you find it?
There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.
Fourteen years down the drain. (points and walks off -- to the bathroom)
Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?
Never. (The elevator door opens.) Wait a second. Thats her. On the right.
Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.
(firmly matter-of-fact) Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.
See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup...
(thoughtful) Hmm, that could hurt me. (pointing out of window) Hey, there it is.
I thought you were gonna watch a video.
Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer)
It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.
And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape.
I don't know how long this is gonna last.
What causes homophobia? What is it, that makes a heterosexual man, worry? I think it's because, men know, that deep down we have weak sales resistance. We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. Men think, "Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'"
Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?
No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.
Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?
So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?
Well, what's to be said? He didn't remember you.
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank me. Goodbye. (Hangs up) Hey, I'm flyin' first class.
(thinking) Bad man? Could've my mother been wrong?
Wait a minute! (A manic chase scene ensues, with Jerry chasing Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.)
Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and they wish they had, had never uh...
Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit)
Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't believe I got the Low Fat!
And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus
Well, look at this guy. Look, hes got everything, hes got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners.  This is not his first load.
Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?
Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didnt want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And its been sitting down there for three years until he saw it. (to Kramer) All right, so, just take what you want and lets get it out of here.
Yeah , she's coming to see my act tonight.
"So what about the Penthouse. Did you ask him?"
oh I though you didn't care about his looks
What do you think the Nazis were doin? (Imitates the Nazis salute) That was the heil-five.
Evry-Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. "Oh, is he good?" "Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best." They can't all be the best. There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, "You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him. No, he's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher." And then there's always that, "Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me." Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, "Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. And everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs."
(as Ping rambles on ) ...S'cuse me (Ping looks up) Kind of an expensive call.
Kramer! (We hear Kramer's door slam open and shut. Kramer enters. Jerry comes out of his room.) Hey! Where's all my sneakers?
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!
Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?
It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him, he makes a "Tada!" gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say "I'll see ya.", and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute)
So we could do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. Whats the matter?
He's got the Kavorca. (looking towards the theater door, Jerry notices one of the movie goers) Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry-cleaner?
.. and uh, underwear and a tee shirt.
Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.
Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. Im sure theyd just as soon give it to you, but youd have to come up with that money.
It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom)
So when are we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?
Yep. Since college. (Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.) Hey, Lena Small's on this list.
I think thats the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!
Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.
I dont give out bites. I got another one. But Im saving it for later.
I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I cant stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion wont even exist. It wont. I think eventually well all be wearing the same thing. Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where theres people from the future or another planet, theyre all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided, This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and boots. Thats it. We should come up for an outfit for Earth. An Earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits. No speeches. They walk out, twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, That was nice. I could wear that.
Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.
Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm alarge.
Can I - can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I can't believe this, I make one innocent comment, about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you?
You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic.
Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. (Kramer picks up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.) Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine! (Kramer starts filling a pot with water.) What are you doing with that?
You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?
Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?
Um, yeah...I think my wife and I'll have a little more coffee.
OK, wait a second, wait a second, what happened to my papers?
Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.
My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything?
Alright, Newman! This is it! (Shoves him against the wall.)
Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!
Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?
Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.
Hey ,You think that Shelly's upset that I made such a big deal about the pecan.
Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.
Well, I just wanted to... (breaks off) You forgot the gift certificate to Barnes and Noble.
Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.
(places two slices of bread against Kramer's face) That is close.
Nope, the cop says its my word against his. Theres nothing they can do.
Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But when you're naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) There's nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging and lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be, wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this (hand in pocket) I think that would really help a lot.
You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!
Oh. No. What, you mean because of the "Chang"?
Oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality.
What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. That was a cool one.
You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?
Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display.
He went to get some steak sauce. Why?
You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?
(TO GEORGE) Hey George, you ever see one?
Well whaddaya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?
Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) You're not going?
I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?
Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series.
You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. "Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies." So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin them whenever I want!
(Tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the machine) I think the candy comes out over there.
We don't hear that. (They enter the elevator)
(he hits a few keys and looks over at her) Cash advance... yes (hits a key)  no (he looks over again) balance inquiry... no (he looks again) receipt.... no (he looks again) processing... processing... (He opens the box, pulls out his money and then looks at the woman and says) I won!
Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.
You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!
Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the, uh...
You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be going downtown?
(hanging up the phone) Oh! There's my Chinese food, I gotta run. All you.
What is this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesnt fit him).
(to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?
Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this, now she's got nothing.
Yeah. (pointing at Elaine as he goes into the bedroom)
Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.
Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.
Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!
Oh, I get it. Why don't you just say it?
You can see it. You gonna walk around like that?
You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?
(Sarcastic) Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?
Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!
Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...
Or I could sleep in the park? You could knock these walls down, make it an eight room luxury suite.
Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?
Yeah, so do you. (George enters with a newspaper.)
Yeah, he's disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV)
Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?
I think he's the same age as the father.
You dont think it mightve had anything to do with that?
Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. Its completely shrunk. Theres absolutely no way I can wear it.
Leo's furious. (He stops in his tracks when he sees Elaine looking at George's book) What is that doing on the table?
I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?
Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?
Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes.
Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!
I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.
Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?
I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!
(as Kramer walks by) You're a master of race relations.
You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.
Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?
"What are you doing that for, you got a job"
I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.
I said pull over by the stop sign.
Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.
They sell them by the side of the road. Blueberry, Blackberry ....
Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.
Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.
Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.
Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich.
Oh! Come om . He'll be over there for a half hour, he gets lost over there. C'mon so what is this about?
Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should really be fun.
Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing.
Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'
No economic reason for them to be here.
There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.
YEAH? (speaking loudly so the visitor can hear him through the intercom)
(mind's voice) Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?
I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.
So you want me to get the books? Is that it?
What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?
Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.
You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon.
Well, you want to sit with George? I think he's coming with Robin.
(To Kramer) Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!
That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. Anyway what can I do, I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow. It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin.
(Obviously mad at the situation he's in) 'Why am I wearing is now?? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why! And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her!
