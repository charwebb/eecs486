She's not there!
(under his breath) This is unbelievable.
(realising) Ohh, I don't believe this. I forgot to give it back. It belongs to the Friars Club.
I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.
Yeah, when it's your money, it's fascinating.
How do you know?
The store.
Why didn't you shave this morning?
Sleeping in the caragain?
So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, I gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didn't?
Hey.
Hello.
Hey, Kramer, over here.
Yeah, so she and "Triangle Boy" can go out to fancy restaurants. (takes a sip of water)
Ahem. Say that again?
But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.
About what?
I can't believe your a friend of mine.
Ill drive you to the airport.
That was brutal. I cant go back out there.
Ya i could try and do that.
Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me?
Let go!
Trust me, you're off.
Hey.
You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.
Hi.
Well, I didnt uh really mean a pony, per se...
(Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.
(Scoffing) Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.
Out of town?
I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand.
Hey.
George got him fired. He squealed on him.
I *just* learned that. (proudly holding the Yo-Yo)
Hey.
Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
Those two?
Pinter?
Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.
Shes gotta be here soon.
I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.
And you want to be my latex salesman.
Drakes Coffee Cake
What's the matter?
(Thinking) What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship. Gotta relax.
No, no, no. I was just in the bathroom with that Bob guy.
Awright, fine. You wanna see it?
Here?
Your hair, its somewhat de-poofed.
Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,
Come on up.
Does it smell like the East River?
It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.
No, no, would you get up?
Just forget it. Let it go.
That's true.
Your good friend is morbidly obese.
To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go "Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch." According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.
Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with you?
Kramer, what are you doing here!?
The pick?
Take what?
Charity?!? That's apalling.
'90.
No. I never had a job.
What?
No actually, she took it pretty well.
But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?
Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...
Oh (laughing) Elaine really? Well that sounds interesting.
You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.
Of course she doesnt have five thousand dollars!
Hello?
You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic.
Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?
(Bitter) Good night, Newman.
Well I started screaming, "There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina." Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running (In the background -- CLERKS VOICE 57) and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.
Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room?
What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the same thing over and over again? Or does she have a closet full of these, like Superman? I've got to unlock this mystery.
You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!
No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?
So, the free love buffet is over?
Why do you say that?
I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show.
Yeah.
Ya?
Hm.
We haven't spoken.
Robert.
Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers are all smudged out. (holds out the ticket and hands it to Bania)
Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream.
Kramer, Kramer, what is this?!
We'll take 'em!
Good morning.
She wanted to thank us for the apartment.
Hello Newman.
It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.
You could be Colin.
No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your trouble..
Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend.
I want that rye, lady!
But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated.
Oh, hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet?
All right, all right, I?ll wear this. It's bad enough I?ve got to go to the opera I?ve got to sit next to ozzie nelson over here.
It's a tell. You gotta tell.
I'll go if someone else drives. You going?
See I was saying "six" but she thought I was saying "sex". We straightened the whole thing out though.
He's George!
New clothes?
Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.
You're not undoing anything.
Yeahhh, am I imagining this? (he whips out the movie stub and holds it up to Willie) Found this little cutie in the pocket. (throws the stub on the counter)
Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.
Here.
I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?
(sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your favourites on hand.
Yeah.
Really? Did you hear that? Somebody else was killed!
Come on. Then you dont have to see him again til my 15,000-mile check.
This could be an emergency!
Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off.
That's what a gym teacher once told me.
All right, I'll see you after school. I,,m late for Hayman's hygiene.
. Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it
Uh, you don't have to take a picture.
Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.
I knew it! I'm not crazy.
Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room. So...
(To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?
Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.
She could have.
I know, George told me.
(Looking at his watch ) Yeah..
Yeah. Yes, she is.
Good. And Ill tell you what... You dont have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.
Oh my stomach. I feel like I'm going to throw up.
A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name?
So?
(whatever) Fine..
No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know.
(pleading) I got a date. C'mon, please.
You did?!
He did?
Well, we fight a lot for some reason.
What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell her?
I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!
He might not want nothing.
I don't know , Who keeps track of Hellos.
Yes. That's what was so vexing.
Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself.
So what? A lot of older men have that.
Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, (lower voice and hurriedly) and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it.
Yeah, you wanna get that meal, don't you?
So...
Hi Ralph.
All right Newman, one more peep outta you, you're out of the whole operation!
I'm sorry, I..
I don't know. That's like asking "Where's Waldo?"
Okay, so what if it moved?
Alright, alright. Uh, undo them. I'll help you get them off.
I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.
I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.
About what?
I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.
You seemed a little mad.
Moved?
No, hes just a little bloated.
(in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.
It was just an innocent comment! I didnt know she had a pony!
(Stops pulling on the pants) Alright, alright, That's no good. (Moves Kramer over to the couch) Let me try getting them from the bottom. (Goes for Kramer's Leg) Just gimme one leg.
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.
I don't want one.
The Jews?
Yes, I heard you.
George, we're trying to have a civilization here.
Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is.
In case of what?
(looking after the guys) That nut is always up to something.
What, you're considering this?
(on phone) Come on Adrian give me another chance, I know I could cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act (pauses for response from Adrian) No new material (Elaine enters) He's never heard it. He'll love it, I just did it at the Concord last week, it killed. (waves hello to Elaine; pauses for response from Adrian) Thank you, thanks fo.. you will not regret this. Ok, Bye. (hangs up phone; to Elaine) Hey.
Oh, I don't believe this.
You like him?
I can't figure out what's going on here. I can't follow the plot. Why did they kill that guy? I thought he was with them?
Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing.
And I don't want you to hold mine!
Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?
I know.
That's strange...
Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.
You think so?
No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.
So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?
I don't know. (takes off his sweater) This sweater really itches me. You want it?
Who are you describin'?
Why is he scared.
No the stools go over there.
It's only nine o clock.
Get outta here.
Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed like ten new minutes.
(whining like Kramer) Ask Newman.
Could you excuse me one second? Im sorry.
It's impossible
The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.
I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.
You never know.
(Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's talking about) What?
Nothing.
(quietly) Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
...'s very emasculating, he doesn't know the nature of our relationship. You're there approving new clothes.....That's a girlfriend job! How dare he!!
Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks.
Have you noticed people staring at your head?
I told you.
No, I don't want that smell in the house.
No way! It's completely under my control.
It's hard enough living next door.
I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--
Plus, you know what else.
Thanks. It's Hounds-Tooth.
Huh?
I met her on an elevator.
Hey! Did you get the Volvo?
Couple of tough monkeys.
Oh. Sounds great.
(turning to Elaine; thinking) Oh no, not now.
"Salami salami bologna"?
Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that "Miss Congeniality" on you, and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone can't make it. (To Karen) Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're not going? (Kramer enters.) Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey, what are you doing tonight?
I don't know.
Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer.
That's funny, that's funny! "I'm sick of cleaning." That's very funny.
Where are you going?
Can I have a piece of that?
You want the tickets?
I thought you saw that already...
So, you think Clyde told him?
Hi.
(Once again, the audience hears his thoughts) I'm so car sick. I'm gonna vomit!
I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.
Yeah.
(Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.
Come on George, just loosen up.
That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and-
Uh, he's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling us to see the baby.
(walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later.
Now he's a character. (Pause) So everybody I know is a character on the show.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term.
Oh hey Phil.
He lives in a bubble.
(TO KRAMER, REBOX) Will you let me help you with that?
I guess he failed to see the humor in it.
Babu? Babu...[waves Babu to come to table] Babu...you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just, it's a little stringy. You have any chicken?
I dont know, I don't feel so good.
Thank you...
No.
No, shes a little too cheery for me.
I was talking to him.
What could you possibly like about that?
yeah, so?
Hey, isn't that George's father?
That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!
What are you talking about?
(TO GEORGE, REWOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy?
No, I don't wanna see the naked people.
How can I want it now, if you want it?
Hey.
Well, guess I'll get going.
So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?
Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.
But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.
Ohhhhh, that's great.
Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number.
What am I gonna say?
How fast was she walking?
Yeah.
Theyre a comedy team.
Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.
You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS!
Are you sure?
Hi Mary.
Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!!
Yeah.
Cat fight with Raquel Welch.
Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out.
Catnap?
I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet.
You ever find anything?
Who?
oh with huh.. pretty boy.. Tony
Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.
I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off.
And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you thinking?
He's... trying to get something off his chest.
(defensive) No no, that's not true!
Oh, Paul, could you hold that door...
You can't go wrong with pouty.
Oh, yeah. Right.
Probably the reason..
No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!
He's like a squirrel.
George!
All right, biff. Elaine, merry-go-round?
Why not?
You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?
I know!
That's good stuff.
I think SHE saw it coming.
(sarcastically) Yeah, Levine. And Im Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here.
Can I take a guess?
Audrey.
What is that?
Hey!
They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.
What do you recommend besides the steak?
You know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on Elaine right in front of me. He stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems to like. You know what I'm gonna do.? I'm gonna take that jacket back.. I'm putting this guy ....RIGHT OUT OF COMMISSION....
I'll take fastidious.
Alright, come on, lets get out of here.
Alright, two hundred, but that's as high as I can go. I really think you're being unreasonable here!
Shell be furious.
Hello.
Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now, too.
If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him.
I had a statue! What should I do?
Oh, you know these jewellers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries, wrapped in a riddle.
Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!
Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!
No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
No! Enjoy your lunch.
Unlce Leo, what are you doing here?
No, no this is more important.
Meryl Streep?
So you dont know whats wrong with him?
Come on up. (Jerry presses the second button and opens the apartment door. He walks back to the couch.) Oh, all right, forget it, Im gonna take it with me now... (He picks up the cushions.) Im just gonna pack up the cushions right now...
What?
Who?
Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.
All right. We're broken up.
Really? What happened?
No, I just wanted to see what time it was.
You're pretty comfortable up there eh, Bubble boy?
I don't know. Blind date?
All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?
So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.
Stop your crying will ya?
Ya, it's much better isn't it?
That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?
Are you serious?
A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?
I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train (yawns)
You left the keys in the car?
By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?
You didn't give that thing back?
I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders if the game was going to be rained out.
Of what?
Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.
Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!
Yeah, how about a mute?
No, no. It's the valet guy.
Im not looking.
What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?
Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guys out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, its true, men hear a drill, its like a dog whistle. Just... (his head perks up) you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, Honey, I think Jims working on something over there. So they run over to the guy. Now they dont actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. Thats what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, What are you using, a Phillips-head? You know, we feel involved. Thats why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, thats just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they dont cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. What are you using the steel girders down there? Yeah, thatll hold.
Get outta here.
You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off.
So?
What bet?
Sure.
What the hell is a plantain.
(to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here?
Where are you going, you just got here?
Well, well, look at you. It?s a little skimpy there isn't it?
That's the understudy. I'm dating her.
Ok, Yeah all right.
Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.
Never happened.
Well, why would I assume. I never assume. Leads to assumptions.
Oh, then I lost interest.
She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.
(Opens the door) C'mon, you wanna go for a ride? (Starts jiggling his keys - as if he's calling out for a dog) Huh? C'mon! C'mon!
When did you get that?
And then the worst part is, after the movie, he leached on to us ... We wound up having coffee with him for like two hours. Then he walks us home, all the way back to the front of the building. Finally I said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now.
Yes, Im lactose intolerant.
Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster.
That's always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus?
Why are you bothering them for?
(disgusted) Ohh! You know, and sometimes shell go, (imitates Marlene) Hello, Jerry? And Ill go, Oh, hi Marlene. And then its Jerry...
I suppose.
Back to my place. That's right.
(zipping up his bag) Sometimes you do.
You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go 'Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If that's what you have to do.'
You told Testikov, (Elaine nods) that Tolstoy wanted to name his book "War-- What Is IT Good For?"?
Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.
You just asked me two minutes ago.
(Disappointed) Oh. Is George there?
Yeah, but this is different , this is like ,you know, semi digested food stuff. You know the next stop is the stomach and you can take it from there.
Pam? What do you care? (Newman shrugs. Jerry notices he's carrying a Brentano's bookstore bag.)
Ah, Le'me see. (hands Jerry the playbill)
All right, all right. Whats the big hubbub, bub?
Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. (hangs up)
We were ten.
He offered it to me.
Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?
You did, you did.
What writer? It's a sitcom.
Flinched? I did not flinch. George, did I flinch?
Did he kiss you good night?
Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise.
Certainly are.
Five minutes.
She's not beautiful.
These the people you currently live with?
(cautiously) Who is it?
You can't put a paper towel on his head.
Svenjolly.
What is his stand...on abortion?
What the hell is going on here?
George's father.
What?
What're we gonna do?
Because you know we used to go out.
Elaine you're missing the whole point.
Yeah who?
all right lets be reasonable, Bania. Im taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think it's a pretty good deal.
Morning?
5-19? What's a 5-19?
He's a little off the wall.
(Interrupts) Excuse me...Excuse me... Are you asking him out ?
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over.
I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?
Katherine Hepburn? Oh yeah.
Yo?
Oh, hi Brett.
(to George) Snow. Snow, that cant be good for suede, can it?
In two days.
How do you know she's not my wife?
A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.
I'm gonna grab a can of balls.
But then we would have missed the whole thing.
(pleased) I'll call George!
What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops.
(To George) Who picked these out?
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.
Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman anything you say she does!
I must have iron rich blood.
(to Kramer) Hey.
Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off.
Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature Channel.
Oh...yeah...uh you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld.
So you lie! What did you tell her?
Oh, cmon! Its down again?!
Hey ya know I read an unbelievable thing about Tolstoy the other day, did you know the original title for "War and Peace" was "War--What Is It Good For?"!
Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.
All right . . . . I once found a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.
The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image.
Oh.
Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer. (Kramer enters)
So, I guess you dont find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming?
Come on up.
(noticing Alec Berg walk in, whispers) Hey, Alec!
Did you tell Peterman about this?
It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make.
So you do live here.
Oh. (Intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it) Yeah?
Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.
What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What do you say? What do you say? No matter what you say, it's a lie. "I'll see you around. See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you around that area. You'll be around other people. You won't be around me. But you will be around." "Take care now." Did you ever say that to somebody? "Take care now. Take care, now. Because, I'm not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, now." "Take care. Take care." What does this mean? "Take off!" Isn't that what you really want to say? "Take off now."
Drop dead?
Yeah! So
What are doing here now?
Who?
Yes!
I mean I have many gay friends...
"What are you doing that for, you got a job"
No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?
It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.
Oh, Babu.
I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back stage and having to think of something to say.
Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.
NOW!!!!.... (she leaves in a hurry)
What do you mean?
It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.
(Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery.
What kind of pie are you cooking?
I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.
Have you said anything to her?
You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out events.
oh..huh.. is she coming up?
(walking up) Pendant? Those bastards.
Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?
Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will *always* trade sleep for sex.
Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
Your mother reads your mail?
I'll call an ambulance. (Exits)
Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll pick her up on something.
That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!
Eleven dollars for what?
It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.
Oh, you know.
I may have mentioned it.
Alright.
You asked a date to go to the operation?
Good idea.
Come on stop.
You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem.
So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?
Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio.
Sure, Beth, these things happen. (Brief pause) So, have you told many.. people yet?
No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?
Whats that one?
Yeah, yeah...
Today's not cold.
Ah, Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
Swivel?
Kramer!
What did you do?
Assman!
Kramer's party.
No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.
I'll pass.
All right.
We'll be outside
Kramer, do you realize what's going on here? Do you know why you're here?
Hey Doc, check this out. [does an around-the-world with the Yo-Yo]
(still outside) What was that?
Yeah?
(Like a little kid) But, I don't want to be a pirate!
No, I don't think so.
Ouch.
(looking ahead) Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh.
I do favors.
I'll remember that.
(quickly) No.
Would you take a drink and let us smell you?
Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look I?m serious, I?m not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it.
That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?
They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.
My bet? All right. Ill open with a tuna sandwich.
"I think I was tucked.!"
Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there.
Non-fat yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even know it.
Kind of in the middle of something here, George.
No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.
C'mon...c'mon...
Duck, Kramer! Duck!
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.
Irish money?
You're saying I'm responsible for the couch?
Enjoyed yourself.
"Ahh! You too with these?"
Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.
Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.
I like that thing in your hair there.
Flowing?
Super bowl! Hey, an original G.I. Joe. (picks up both items) With a full frogman suit.
Hi
It's here!
(pointing Kramer) He drank it.
Hey, all right. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to see you here... Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those orange cones you have on the throughway... (Sees pilot) on the way... up here... um... I..
What?
Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?
You've got a little rage.
So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job.
So take it.
I know. It's like X-ray vision.
You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?
No deal. Why?
(Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..
But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?
(surprise) You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building too?
What if I can't keep up?
Hey, is Davola outside?
What show?
I didnt bring anything.
Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this. (The door buzzer sounds, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
Lets talk about that.
(Over the top) Yes, I'm proud to say I did!
But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.
Just call me if you hear anything. (hangs up and faces Kramer) Well? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!
Nice to meet you.
(examining the button) Boy, look how far back it goes. It's like a tooth.
I know. I was just...
(startled) Kramer!
you're fine (goes to the bathroom)
Boy, they seem pretty angry about something.
(under his breath) Oh no.
Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?
On the other hand...
Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.
Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign.
You know, Schumann went mad from that.
She is?
I DON'T WANT IT ....
You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.
Really? Its over?
A preemptive breakup.
(sarcastically) Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.
. . . it's uh, being fixed.
(Looks around his apartment) Is it better than mine?
Hi.
Yeah.
I thought there were two outs.
C'mon, you're lucky to have anybody.
You mean stakeout the lobby?
That's it! No more questions! I don't care!
No, I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut, he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.
All right come on in. ... Just wait over HERE! Just wait here and I'll get it for you. ... Kramer this is Tia.
Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what I set out to do.
What for?
Ya take it easy.
Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line.
Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!
Its a joke.
Dad I'm paying.
All the time.
She should just give up.
(fidgets like he has no room with George next to him)... Could you move over there?!
What? (Kramer hands Jerry an envelope) My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you find it?
Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A.
Thirteen thousand.
I'm watching Edward Scissorhands.
I'm just glad it's outta here. (Elaine exhales deeply - getting over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) What's that? (Pointing to a rolled up poster Elaine is carrying)
I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!
Who?
You think I'm too cautious?
There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?
Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes.
Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again? (listens) Oh really? Well you can't break up with me over the phone. C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me. (hurriedly) Why d'you wear the same dress all the time? Hello.
Hello, oh hi Duncan, 400 o'clock tomorrow? That is not going to work. . . . Why? I'll tell you why. Because I chose not to run!
So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out anything that comes into your head.
Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona, how does that hurt me?
"What the hell his a velvet fog."
I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van.
Well, Poppie's a little sloppy.
You're going out with the stationery store guy?
That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood.
I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didn't work.
Sure.
Your trench coat in my closet?
Hello?
well, you know, sometimes a square is everything
No kidding.
Hi
Ah, I don't know if he likes her as much as he likes it.?
...the...the...
You raise the feet, get blood to the head.
Would she have hooks?
Well, how else could this have happened?
Nah, you're crazy anyway.
Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.
So, how did you meet him?
That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.
Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven.
I didn,t tell you to park in that lot .. Now someone's gonna have to drive you every time you need your car.? Take the bus!
I want that picture.
Two.
You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.
Take it.
I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce you get impeached and you're not even the president!
Dude!
You sure?
Hi Evelyn.
Why?
Hes a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.
Tremendous workout.
So, you're just taking off from work?
What is this?
Its too far.
You don't think she's attractive?
Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series.
Bye, Dad. Take it easy.
I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and Ill just make up some excuse why I cant go to the game either.
They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.
Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.)
Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that.
(defensive) He egged me on.
It's 1030 in the morning?
I'm not sure, but I think she was nice. (takes a sip of water)
I'm telling and you can't stop me!
Thank you very much. O.K. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!
I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?
Youre in there again.
Hi, is Sandy here?
Well, let's start the insanity.
He's in Pakistan.
Yeah, he seems pretty happy.
Elaine, you're among friends.
Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.
You know, a TV show.
Do you like the Drake?
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
Over here. You can see right through here.
Yeah.
DeSoto? What did he do?
What, Elaine?
Ohh ... (takes the ticket and heads for the dressing room)
Hey, how's the anti-mail campaign going?
Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?
I want that rye lady.
Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.
All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you.
I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
That's my walkman!
Cup of tea with lemon.
Sample? (under his breath) Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book.
No, but ah, seen any good movies lately?
Yeah..... He caught me So here's what I want you to do. Come back with me to the store and we'll pretend to look at the coat.
The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.
What's over?
different for a man
Mmm.. Bad how?
(out of window) George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!
You don't want any of this?
(Stern on George) Not underpants.
Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.
(Sarcastically) Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.
So, he's definitely married, huh?
(To his parents) So? What do you think?
You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...
I sound funny?
Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back)
You know what it was, bad location.
Hi how are ya?
Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.
I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass!
Was it pimple popper MD?
I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot.
Elaine, George (introducing them to Bania with less enthusiasm)
What?
It's subtle.
Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.
Tell me about it!
The engine's made by McDonnell-Douglas.
That's a shame.
Right.
Who takes care of your boy during the day?
To Latvian Orthodox?
She's your Lex Luthor!
I don't understand what the big deal is.
He called you?
What happened?
How d'you know?
You don't drink.
What's his problem?
All right, I'm, i,m takin' the camera.
What do you mean like post-cards an...?
I think we might have one left in the stock room.
World's collide. (points at George)
Huh?
Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business.
Hes an importer/exporter.
(giving him a steak from the fridge) Here ya go.
Are you sure?
Oh. No. What, you mean because of the "Chang"?
...Yeah.
hey hey (fooling around with his collar)
How much could you possibly have in there?
It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?
No, Nothing.
(To Kramer) Talk - call him from your house. (Elaine enters. Kramer leaves. To phone) He's calling you now.. okay. (Hangs up)
Hey, ??? is rerunning the Yankee game. You watching this?
Yeah.
No, you didn't.
Uh huh, what's that?
Ok, see you later.
Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it.
(after entering) The bedroom!
(fetching a drink from the fridge) Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money.
Elaine, have you ever flown first class?
Oh, so you need to know?
Which one you wanna go to shmoopy?
I dont know.. fifteen hundred dollars.
Was it in the trash?
He feels funny. You don't have to do this.
So forget about your clothes.
No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.
Okay..
What happened to you?
Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back
I'm sorry.
(Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right.
Hi.
Hi, sorry I'm late.
Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay, thank you very much. (To Kramer) I found Mom and Pop, they're sellin' my sneakers!
Last week on Seinfeld.
I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, Well, its ruined. And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, Its not our fault. Were not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation. You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? Theyre cleaning our clothes, but theyre not getting anything wet. Its all dry. I know theres gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that theyre using. Theres no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (Jerry brushes off his shirt.) Thats dry cleaning. I dont think thats what theyre doing back there. They dont have eighty guys going, Come on, hurry up! Theres a lot of shirts today!
Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.
No.
I can't wait.
What about, what about this thing?
Oh, the beach.
(pulling on a jacket) They had a cancellation and they instantly called me.
Boy, your really packing it all in.
Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited.
Oh it's a fascinating field!
Just, look, just give the keys.
Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He planned the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal.
Hey, Tim.
THIS is your hiding place?! (Elaine laughs)
Discount?
Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?
He went crazy from one note. He couldnt get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized.
You liked, Newman?
But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity.
Hey, I called you last night, where were you?
He's looking on to fridgerator.
Hey, hey.
Inka-dink, a bottle of ink, the cork fell out, and you stink.
Tuck in, tuck in.
Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him?
Hey, guess what! Little Jerry ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!
Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?
We dont understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you cant stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I dont see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, lets make up our mind where we think theyre going.
They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
Tough day at the office?
Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.
You want to get a bite?
Whatever.
Oh, about the... uh (Jerry pretend to wash his hands)
That is out there.
They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out!
What is your problem?
He's got the Kavorca. (looking towards the theater door, Jerry notices one of the movie goers) Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry-cleaner?
I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it.
I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.
What about your father's car?
Alright! (picks up the phone and dials) Hello, Alec? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. You know, you got a great 'John Houseman' name. Alec Berg. Did you hand in your assignment, Mr. Berg?
I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?
Cheapness is not a sense.
thanks
Yeah. a-hu. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?
Sadly, that knowledge could've help me.
He pulled an LBJ on you.
Yeah...
Maybe this isn't my coat.
Fred?
Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?
Alright, but let me ask you this question.
I'm not in the mood.
Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god. Wel-- how did this happen? What can I do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye. (Hangs up) That was Roy. He's under investigation for insurance fraud.
Right.
Yes I was.
Projectionists.
(answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back.
Are those the same shoes as yesterday?
Boogeyman.
Hey. The butler's here.
WE HAD A PACT!!!
We were too compatible Our conversations were so engrossing.
No, road is a major detail!
Opening.
She seems very nice.
Hey, is that my maple syrup? Oh, ya. (Kramer hands it over.)
What the hell are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be at work?!?
That's nice of you to say.
(pause as he realizes) Oh, no.
Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in the Immigration Department, they're gonna straighten the whole thing out, the wheels are in motion, things are happening even as we speak!
Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?
Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back.
They could at least try it.
(lacking enthusiasm) Yeah, yeah.
Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person -
We'll be funny.
What?
I don't know if he's mad.
Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.
All right.
Well, thats a lot of money. But, if thats the way its gotta be, thats the way its gotta be.
Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.
This is quite a condo.
You're behind in the count.
Uh-huh.
No, actually I was just gonna...
You didn't like that crack about the pen.
Well you implied it.
I know, I know.
Toilet brush, oh (he pulls a 'Damn, shoulda guessed!' face). Alright, I can replace that.
(answering the ringing phone) Hello?
(Nodding) Yes. Yes I am. (Kramer chuckles) Master of my domain. But I will tell you this I am going over to (Gestures to the nudist) her apartment, and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down!
Ya, what's there to talk about.
Yeah! it's all taken care of.
Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
I get peeved.
This is no good. This is no good. Call her house.
The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.
Yeah!
Can I make it up to you? Ill give you fifty bucks for the jug.
What? Nothing.
No, no Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.
Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!
Not possible.
What are you doing here?
It's gotta have something to do with Kramer
Good thing the cleaning lady was there.
Oh, yes you will.
I forgot.
Hi.
No hello?
Good, good.
Your friend, Noreen.
Absolutely not.
What are you gonna get?
This is my friend George.
How highs it suppose to go?
But not here. (They leave.)
Yeah. She would love cashmere.
What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?
He couldn't believe it.
I think Ed Begley Jr. has one.
Gimme ten.
To see a movie.
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.
(going along with it) Oh No!
Why don't you start in the bedroom?
He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.
I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.
Take care
Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!
White Plains.
Yeah.
You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor story??
Maybe you're getting' a raise.
Well then the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend. I'm sure you flourish at this location for many, many years.
Oh, the sisters (he sits at the table)
So, what ever happened with that?
What's with the fake sneezing?
She went out to get her head shaved.
(unenthusiastic) Oh, the gum.
Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?
Thanks.
What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave them to me, how many time I gotta thank him?
Cause I hit a whopper last week!
Maybe you should check with the rabbi.
(moving over to block the door) Where are you going?
You?
I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different... sources.
No, no, not at all.
Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.
Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that yogurt.
Hey, guess what? The Drake broke up.
Alright, I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine.
Oh! but I do. There's probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar. ( as he says this Newman is wildly scratching behind his back. he suddenly stops when Jerry turns around)
So, what's good tonight?
Could be.
Really? I thought...
Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into contact with --
But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen.
Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!
I guess I would.
We split it.
Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it. (listens) Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye.
Don't worry. We won't forget!
(smug) I'm not engaged.
Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly.
Because you didnt have a job?
Well, I . . . [sees George]
Why didn't you eat it in the cab?
Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?
What for?
Not more of that crap from the Titanic?
They make wigs out of human hairs?
What do you think the worst part of being blind is?
How could you leave a message like that on my machine.?
That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.
They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor.
Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning.
At the zoo?
Keep following him Kramer. don't let me down.
So they have hotdogs there.
(grabbing the list from Kramer) You're not getting any plantains.
(jocular) You just bought your own dinner.
This has 'international incident' written all over it.
(Only turning back for a second) Hey.
Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck.
Now, I should tell you that, at this point, she's under the impression that youre - a - ah
Just don't make a scene.
Hey, shall we spit on him?
So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing.
(Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.
I should have helped Kramer with those packages.
Brave new world, alright.
George used up all my guest passes already.
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second. ! Celebrate! How about some champagne?
Compact, lipstick, all this?
What is all this?
You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril.
Isn't he, Elaine?
Where you goin'?
What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.
How about a Napoleon?
Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch?
Why?
What is that?
why do you do that?
Seinfeld.
Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman.
Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch hour and just take it?
Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall!
You're going to the Super Bowl?
How you gonna get me up there?
I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.
No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one.
So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you?
Really?
At least you'll be talking.
Like a grandmother, why?
Just had a big bowl of Kix.
Yes I did.
A Mister Kenneth Bania.
(quiet) Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..
Yeah, go ahead, take it.
(simultaneously) I hate you!
Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.
You mean golf?
Hey.
Depends.
Did you see the look on that guy's face?
She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out and files off-screen. George reacts deeply)
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
A bigger bill?
You should try this.
You went all night?
Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of you.
Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. >click click<
I don't know.
What?
Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing!
Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. (various patrons give the thumbs up in approval) When are you getting out of there?
I heard something.
Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back.
You did?
Son's of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off.
Newman's his mailman.
And what's gonna happen?
So, Wilkinsons out of the hospital now?
Yes you did.
See ya.
So youre saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, its all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.
50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.
(positive) Fantastic. Fantastic woman.
Don't feel right? What are you talking about?
If I told you, you woulda given it away.
Because he's my butler!
Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it.
Uh-huh.
Right in front of me!. How do you know we're not together. Two guys, sittin' laughin' drinking Champagne Coolies.
I dont know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down. I cant decide.
That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.
We're not leaving the car!
You were watchin'? Where?
Oh hi, Katie.
Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket.
Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?
What is the difference?
What is the matter with you?
(seeing Fredo's tombstone) Oh, my God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up! (hands the shovel to Kramer)
I hired her from a service!
But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment shes going right for that machine.
Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.
Just clarifying.
(pointing to napkins; to Elaine) Could I get napkin over there?
This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!
What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back.
I'll tell you what happened. We got married.
Hey Drake! Hi Drake!
Um, who do I make it out to?
You know Dad just called me.
Mine!
She went on in some detail about certain activities, illegal in some states, for consenting adults. Things you would know very little about.
You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it.
You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.
What's the harm?
(grudging) Alright.
Really? I'll have to remember that.
(Pointing) He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight..
What colour is it?
What do you think the dry-cleaners is your own personal closet!
Do you see him?
George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!
Well, you want to sit with George? I think he's coming with Robin.
I don't wanna be a 32.
Some of us.
Manly.
Im gonna make an appointment for you. Well go together.
No, Im gonna take my car.
Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's.
(belated) Good night.
Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?
Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.
Alright, I'll take it.
That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.
We'll always have...pancakes.
She could have mentioned the conversation.
Hey, it's one thing if I asked you "Could you do me a favor?" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE (Obviously up to something. Jerry doesn't suspect anything - yet) Whey you told me what you went through on the plane, it makes you stop and think. You appreciate having a real friend.
Sure.
Well, Gail Cunningham.
It's like we're living in the '50s here.
Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why dont we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. (All three sit down) Now, look, you both find each other attractive, right?
Well, this is great.
I just don't understand the raisinettes.
No, no, no. Just hypothetically.
You can see me naked. I can offer you that.
We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, they're up there going, hey maybe we should give those two guys, who have no experience and no idea, more money!?
Why?
(startled - eyes wide open) Hello, is somebody there? (scurrying sound) Mr.- Mr. Marbles?
Ohh boy. Well, I gotta meet Elaine and run some errands. So.. (Goes for his coat)
Why, what's wrong? (he grabs her hands and force her to keep them on his shoulders)
Kramer!
Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie "Cinderfella". I got 'em at an auction.
Well, whoopie whoop. (Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer staggers in the door in his bathrobe.)
Last week, on Seinfeld.
Unless you're married.
Yeah, I looked. I saw.
(To Kramer) All right, were goin in.
I guess he graduated.
You're gonna take this kid to Paris?
Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can.
She's Gooone.
Shes really hungry.
Great talkin' to you. (Nina leaves. To himself) What the hell is e-mail?
We are dead.
How do you make sure your gonna get to the third date?
No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.
That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. (goes knocking on Kramer's)
They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.
Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?
No, supermarket.
Hey, hey! I'm with someone.
But I never walk you home.
You wanna grab lunch?
I'll be back on Monday.
Well... theres a little bit of a problem.
I would say every two and a half to eight weeks.
That's nice.
You don't look well.
Uhn-uh-uhn - Uhn-uh-uhn - - veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer A-Ha ha! Mission accomplished! Back to base, Joe. (singing) dee, de-de, de-de-de-de-de (Makes G.I. Joe swim off, legs kicking)
Huh?
(Sarcasticly joking) It certainly has.
Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car.
40. Perfect. Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?
Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the transition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses... I need an awkward pause.
Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?
That was a one in a million Mohel.
Nooo.
All right, lets go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.
Now of the course the thing is Extreme sports. Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. It's like a Wiley Coyote idea isn't it? The thing I wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets? Can you almost make it? Why don't they just wear a party hat? What's the difference? You jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute doesn't open I got news for you, the helmet is now wearing you for protection. Later on the helmet's talking to the other helmets going "boy it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly."
Well, they might hook us up again.
(Shocked at his parents) You're stealing too?!
Well, you're your own boss now.
(barring the way) I'm sorry. I-I don't know you.
Why don't you get somebody else?
You've gotta smell the car
Heeeey!
You're still trying to gget that free sub?
And who makes the switch?
Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. It's just for show.
No, no. Still doin the big sweep across.
(bewildered) Why would she try and kill you?
It's hell. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal examination. I would have killed this man. Torn him limb from limb, ripped the flesh right off his bones ...
How about we leave and, come back in a week?
Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. (To George) So, you goin' to the funeral?
Where are they already?
Oh, hey Bania.
Well you know what this means, don't you?
Eh, show biz...
Maybe we should call this off.
So think you can handle this?
A pawn shop?
(looking at his nostrils) I don't...think so.
"You know! Like a tennis shirt."
It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
What date? It's a GUY.
To me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that I did work in an office. Is that when you go in, in the morning you say Hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them. I mean you walk in "morning Bill, morning Bob, how you doing? fine" Ten minutes later you see him in the hall, "How ya doin'?" Every time you pass you gotta come up with another little greeting. You know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow "Hey" You start coming up with nicknames for them. "Jimbo."
Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you.
All right.
It's ludicrous..
We had quite a little chat.
Well, whatever. So, how've you been?
It is a tad askew.
Ok.
Nice try.
So you started drinking.
That's right, you let him have it.
No.
Hey, good luck with that.
Yes, it's very strange. Very strange.
Mom, I'm not married.
So, Winona had the TV Guide. Told you I'd make it up to you.
Bania.
Stomach ache?
You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. (Picks up the phone.) She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number...
Hang on just let me pick up a paper.
Wait a second. .Just give me a second
I once got Happy New Yeared in March.
Alright.
You're never gonna make it!
C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something.
They're closing. We're going for one last slice.
Okay. (He leaves)
Alright. (Approaches host) Excuse me, this is your party, right?
(Confused) What does that mean?
You're a shmoopy!
Just get the key and let's get out of here.
Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right.
I think I've seen that look.
What?
Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage, sighing deeply. Instantly, a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise)
Boy shes sexy isnt she?
And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.
What song?
Well, thank you very much.
You don't seem too bothered by it.
Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.
Thank you very much.
You thought I was gonna get married?
Kinda cool lookin'..
Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.
I've gained eight.
Aw, looks just like you.
I've got a black eye.
George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
(worked up) Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take your jacket, then they just throw it? I never heard of that!
Whatley. (Like "Newman")
You're a shmoopy!
Well they do work on tips.
It was wonderful.
Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.
I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.
She did kind of touch my face.
think I've changed my mind.
So Miranda's cooled on ya?
We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.
Yeah, I think you would.
Really?
Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime.
Where did you get this thing?
Well there's always a place for you, on our team.
Take care now. So long.
They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. Kramer doesn't want a record.
Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?
Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses.
What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the drinks now?
All right. But then I can't tell you the BIG news.
Take the K-man.
By Elaine Benes?
It's not like that at all.
(thinks) Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people the way I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a Nobel Prize?
Nine sixty.
I don't want to.
They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!
I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in the car!
This is amazing, you can't believe this!
Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp.
It's a mammal.
What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a man and George doesn't want to hear his girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do I
It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.
(Looking away) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
George this is Mickey.
Here we go.
Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...
Elaine, what do you think?
(to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...
.... (silence)
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!
So what your genitals are still lined up.
Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?
They're uncomfortable.
You ready?
Are you kidding?
Didn't you see the sign on the door?
Your off-Broadway play.
Whad you think Susan?
No. Why?
I like that. (He opens the closet. Elaine walks out with an angry look.) What do you think, George?
Sounds familiar.
Hey, Elaine.
Wavy.
So forget about the books. Did you read them?
Where are your pants?
Hey, what happened? Did you get your racquet?
And the guy never knows?
What is that stench? I got it. (He follows the smell to Kramers door) Ah hah.
Nah, I don't think so.
He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?
Keep it. (implied please)
George.
Kramer, let's do this later.
Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.
Oh, no. I explained the whole thing to him, he was fine with it.
What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him, I dont think were right for each other. Hes a guy! At least with a woman, theres a precendent. You know, the relationship goes sour, you end it.
(holding up a piece of paper) I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.
Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this uh considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check?
I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday.
Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.
Who?
"The Velvet fog?"
I didnt know. Kramer told me about the worlds.
Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen.
Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.
How did you lock your keys in the car?
Yes, I'm fine.
Well, I guess we'll be going.. (Heads for the door)
I dont think so. You know they, theyre so fragile.
No. You?
Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me.
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?
Isn't that against the law?
No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?
Where did you meet this guy?
You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do.
Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?
Thats comforting. Shh. Hes coming. (to Ray) Ray?
Get off of me.
No, let's survey first. Camp here.
It's supposed to be hot.
Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?
What are you doing here?
All of a sudden you get hungry?
I'll just call her when you leave!
We're gonna change the system.
But you didn't really do any work.
No, not yet.
Then that's the meal.
What?
Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me, they want me to come out and do the show on the 28th and they're giving me two free tickets to LA. You wanna go?
What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?
She's got nice calves.
(continuing) The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.
Yeah?
He asked me to. We were getting along.
Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.
What do you mean, no?
You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.
Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business.
Hey, how's business?
All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry.
Hey
So what are you going to do with the mattress?
I gotta say, thats pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.
Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan.
That's him.
I don't know anything about that.
That's my car!
Was it eaten?
(to himself) This is a new one.
All right. I'll call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from George] Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. well thank you very much. [hangs up] She has been in town. She's at CALVIN KLEIN's right now.
Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?
What?
Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila.
Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings. Alright, it's time to go. Come on.. Up.
What about bran?
I admit it. I don't watch it.
Trouble
Oh, it's a scene.
You killed Fredo!
Are you?
You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.
Okay, you tell me. What is it worth?
Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot.
What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What are you Peter Lorre?
Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other?
Oh, my god!
No Jon Voight Day, huh?
Kramer?
Boo!
I wanna see what's happening.
I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.
(pause) If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?
Wow, what happened?
I'm laying down! Then we'll see how he does up there, without all the assistance.
Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me.
Kramer.
(uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.
Oh, hi Rita.
I did not. You guys gonna go through some red lights?
Well, he cant kill me, right?
Newer magazines.
(Takes the bottle from him) Just swallow 'em.
No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?
That has nothing to do with it.
What?
Uh-huh. Yeah. So, anybody specific?
Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs.
Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs.
George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.
Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on. >click click click<...
Oh, whos gonna know?
Did you have a good time?
Call Rachel.
Yeah all right.
So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris!
Bender.
But you know... not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me.
(To George) You're off bread. (To Elaine) So what happened is it over?
(Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!
Oh. Yeah.
I did not cheat.
Really?
In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?
Come on, lets go.
I'm on next, right?
Yeah, Koko.
Oh, then I gotta tip him.
Buddy?
All right. (picks up the alarm clock) Let's check out the clock. Notch good... 650... volume check. (music playing, he starts swinging) What kinda music you wanna wake up to? Top 40, classical...
I there. This is Kramer, and Frank.
Sure.
Oh no, where's the blood? (opens the fridge) It's in here isn't it?
For some time... (video of Elaine dancing on the street with Jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.
You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me.
I know, and then you say to yourself, From this moment on, Im not gonna waste any more of it. But then you go, How? What can I do thats not wasting it?
You two know each other?
Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?
What's the rope for?
Just a quick peek. I'm in agony.
Uh huh, okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do some TV spots for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store. That was Leapin' Larry himself, I'm gonna meet with him tomorrow.
You don't wanna get married?
Ah, so, ah, flower shows and, shopping for pretty bows, and then back to her place, strip down to bra and panties for a tickle fight?
"You find you need to use a lot of obscenities at the dentist.
What was that?
You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?!
What are you going to get her?
I did. Im just curious. Its been almost a week. I want to check it out. (He finds the stock.) Six points? (to Vanessa) Its up six points!
I don't know.
(to Kramer) Uh... may I help you? (wondering what the hell's Kramer doing)
Hey, can I have my dollar back?
Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here. (hangs up) Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike.
We'll stay in a hotel tonight.
Nah, I don't wanna
The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren?
(still in tuxedo, tie undone) Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building.
I don't know...
It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum.
No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.
Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves, open door reveals Kramer, sitting on his lawn chair with a sparkler)
What's coming?
But if you go back with me , then I'm not.
Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?
You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.
Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.
How can I ever have you over? Youll sit there moping.
I was got to be 55.
Do I what?
Hey, would you stop it already?
Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt to my mother, my mother to my uncle...
What's so special up here?
Hand it over. Pay up.
You know, what you need is a song you can share.
Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?
Why?
Youre doing this yourself?
(not really) Yeah.
(Pleading) Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.
I read it in Ann Landers.
(reading) 'I, Cosmo Kramer, having just seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness, and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie, hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine, lung-blower, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.'
No thanks.
You know, this is your coat.
Sure.
Yeah! But it never works. You know we're supposed to be there by two o'clock. We should take a cab.
(Crying) What--what is this salty discharge?
He's got like a chemical imbalance. He needs to be on medication.
Elaine?
But not anymore.
But that guy has my jacket.
Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?
Oh well, thank you, Marcelino.
How did you know about that?
Hello?
What, did you lose your remote?
That Arabian is strong coffee.
Oh. (notices a car being jacked up by a tow truck) Hey, isn't this Kramer's car? (yelling up) Hey, Cosmo!! They're towing your car!!
She asked about you.
I don't know what this is.
I thought you were on strike?
Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.
It's a nervous tic. I'm on L-Dopa.
The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.
Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?
Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land.
Hey. What are you doing?
(To George) Easy big fella.
yeah without a doubt, I'm down (Kramer enters) oh hey how're you doing? Jane this is my neighbor Kramer
