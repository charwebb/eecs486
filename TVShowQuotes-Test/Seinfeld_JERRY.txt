(as George picks up a broken piece of his car) You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out...
Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.
Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal.
You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?
I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it.
Hey Seth. Man it is coming down hard out there.
Uh huh. Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?
And then the worst part is, after the movie, he leached on to us ... We wound up having coffee with him for like two hours. Then he walks us home, all the way back to the front of the building. Finally I said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now.
How can I ever have you over? Youll sit there moping.
No, its okay now, that, that girl is not comin. Uh, I misread the whole thing.
Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door [Jerry pushes his door against Kramer's entrance]
I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.
(Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?
No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!
Hey, look, there's Bobby Eighteen?s father-in-law, Mr Reichman. George and I were just talking about that today, I can?t believe it! That?s the guy who threw George out of the wedding.
No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant.
Anyway, I just called to tell you that, I'm there for you.
I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.
Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.
(walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later.
You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didnt take it. (pointing to himself) This is an idiot.
Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.
Y'know, I think I'll pass on the "Guys And Dolls"...
Uhm, see the key to eating a Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than, vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved.
Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? To me tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. "That'll be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh."
Oh, what's the matter this doesn't interest you?
Wow! Zanadu . No wonder youre putting in so many hours. (looks at urinal) May I?
I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens answer the door...)
Well, go in there and talk to her. She's not going to put em on the glass.
Hey, thanks a lot for lettin' me stay here.
How many session did my parents paid for?
Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, its with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I mightve been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge.
So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about anything?
So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life saving doctor and I'm just a comedian...
Doesnt matter. Whats the young mans name? I would like to meet him.
I might need you to get me a soda.
I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!
(disoriented) How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?
No! [throws her purse back at her] No, I mean, no thank you, nah...
Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.
(to George) Is that uh, other apartment still available?
I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy.
I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?
It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.
So was I right? She likes me, right?
This is some beautiful parking spot you got here.
She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.
I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany.
Ya what was this? (HE IMITATES MOHEL'S FLINCHING)
You dont have to say Wow. I know its Wow. (Kramer smiling) And theres that smile again. Well, what is that? (Intercom buzzes.) Its George.
Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.
All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting.
Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.
(animated) They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!
Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... (to himself, cursing her) Mulva!
I don't know. I just feel he should call me.
Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie?
Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.
Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta pay this guy the money..
The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song?
(Joking) You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.
But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people.
A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's none of my business.
I don't like this Kramer. Will it be much longer?
Now of the course the thing is Extreme sports. Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. It's like a Wiley Coyote idea isn't it? The thing I wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets? Can you almost make it? Why don't they just wear a party hat? What's the difference? You jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute doesn't open I got news for you, the helmet is now wearing you for protection. Later on the helmet's talking to the other helmets going "boy it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly."
I didnt open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.
And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.
That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'.
How much was it to clean the vest?
yeah yeah what is it with you and Tony? what are you? it's like his sidekick now?
I tell you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table.
"Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his long-time *companion* seem to be inseparable..." Oh no! The Associated Press picked up the NYU story. That's going to be in every paper! I've been "outed"! I wasn't even "in"!
Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.
You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.
So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise?
I'm going to the hospital, to visit Fulton.
Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt to my mother, my mother to my uncle...
(picks up newspaper, turns to George) You always take the shirt off?
You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had my chance and that's that.
Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was that?'
It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.
Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him?
You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this flounder?
(answering machine) Leave a message. I'll call you back. Thanks.
"...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!"
What do you mean? Why wouldn't I know his name?
I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y. (he spits it into the waste bin)
And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus
Let me get a clean pair. (Goes into his room. George strides over to the window.)
I'm callin' Elaine. See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley.
(Like a father) Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.
No, nonsense. This one's fine. (as he sits on the table)
Yeah, but I'm a little uncomfortable. I'm afraid of making another mistake.
(trying to ease the tension) Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends.
(quietly) Hey, uh, Milos, I don't mind rolling over here, but could you lighten up on the 'not a man' stuff?
(takes the card from Elaine) We had a little fight this afternoon. (reading from card) Let's bury the hatchet. We smoke um peace pipe.
She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?
I really have to go to the bathroom.
Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight)
Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.
Well I thought we'd both be getting married.
So go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.
That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.
All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before---
Uh huh. When youre on a stakeout, do you find its better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?
Flinched? I did not flinch. George, did I flinch?
He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?
Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right baby-doll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.
The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate's into the manage too.
My moms down in Florida. Shes got uh one of those condos. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?
So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and stand outside your own building?
(Handing her a small bottle) Here, drink this.
Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.
Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?
George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long.
(turning to Elaine; thinking) Oh no, not now.
I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.
Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food.
(having an idea) I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.
(buzzes her up) Eh. (to Kramer) You know and I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying "my wife." Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - "my wife" this, "my wife" that...it's an amazing way to begin a sentence.
I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport.
Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye.
C'mon up. (Slightly opens the door for Elaine)
But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates.
If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen.
(Into phone) Kramer says it's up to the cat now. (To Kramer) It'll be on your conscience.
Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys.
It's like Im talking to my Aunt Sylvia here.
It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
Shake is bad, but what if its the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?
(calls) Hey you two. Im ready to go.
When did you get tickets to see that?
Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off that sign?
All of a sudden it hit me, I realized what the problem is; I can't be with someone like me.. I hate myself!! If anything I need to get the exact opposite of me....It's too much. It's too Much I can't take it ...I can't take it!!!
Uh, THANKS! This is FUN! Yeah, this turned out to be a GREAT weekend.
You know why? Because people like to say "salsa." "Excuse me, do you have salsa?" "We need more salsa." "Where is the salsa? No salsa?"
Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.
Why didn't you eat it in the cab?
(suspicious) I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.
I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath.
It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.
Oh my eh, my Aunt's name is Mulva. She's-she's a masseuse.
The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.
Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a no-tuck.
you know, I think George has a non-sexual crush on him
All right, so I had wooden teeth, so what?
Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that.
Yeah, so she and "Triangle Boy" can go out to fancy restaurants. (takes a sip of water)
Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.
I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.
Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those...''. ``I hate those... I love those...''. And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M and a light brown, M&M. That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. "Well, your red is more of a main course M&M, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor; it's an after dinner M&M, really''.
Who's got a tissues? I need more tissues! Look at this thing. It's my phone finger!
Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?
You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.
So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk.
Hes a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.
So you say she was on a horse?
I'm not letting you cheat, Newman. You're not getting anywhere near that board.
What are you talkin about? Its fine, I love having you here.
I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I dont know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because its really not a definite thing yet. (crowd cheers him on to tell them) Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that Ive received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. (audience applauds) Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. That's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didnt even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, thats what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, You may have already won. Id like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, You have definitely lost! You turn it over, giant printing, Not even close! You open it up, theres this whole letter of explanation, Even we cannot believe how badly you have done in this contest.
I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?
Ok, great, well, I'm glad everything worked out, Babu.
How'd you expect to get out of here?
I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.
Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.
Look, let me just give you the forty, plus another twenty for your trouble.
"Did you notice he always refer to himself in the third person. Jimmy can dunk. Jimmy's new in town. Jimmy we'll see you later."
I always get confused in the movie theater by the, by the plot. It's embarrassing. It's an embarrassment to have to admit, but I'm the one that you see in the parking lot after the movie talking with his friends, going, "Oh, you mean that was the same guy from the <beginning>... Ohhhhhhhhhh..." Nobody will explain it to you. When you're in the theater, you can't find out. [whispering to imaginary friends seated around him] "Why did they kill that guy?... Why did they kill him?... Who was that guy? What was the... I thought he was with them? Wasn't he with them? Why would they kill him if he was with them? Oh, he wasn't *really* with them.... I thought he was with them. It's a good thing they killed him.''
She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know.
Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? What did I do?
Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin?
(Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.
People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
Now, what is it that you do, exactly?
I dont give out bites. I got another one. But Im saving it for later.
What is that stench? I got it. (He follows the smell to Kramers door) Ah hah.
Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!
(Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the script?
They sell them by the side of the road. Blueberry, Blackberry ....
..living together after a while we... we might start to get on each others nerves a little.
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.
Toilet brush, oh (he pulls a 'Damn, shoulda guessed!' face). Alright, I can replace that.
So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it?
Hear that? Guess who's back. (Opening the door) Hey!
Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable.
So you just pretended it didnt bother you?
I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me "C'mon Jerry, go along, go along..."
You know, I don't even know my IQ.
I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?
(hits button) Come on up. (opens door a little)
(trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents.
Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!
George, it says it here on the phone. It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard. Aha, ok...do we know where the 101 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 170 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 134 is? (George just looks at Jerry) No. Aha, ok. (Jerry hangs up) He's gonna send a black and white to pick us up.
Got lost? We went to school here for three years.
Hey, how ya doin'? Y'know I got that reporter from the newspaper on the other line.
Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?
Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.
I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.
George is pickin' us up at the airport.
By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?
Hello. Oh! Hi George.......What! ..really! All right I'll call Elaine , we'll meet you down there.
Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.
No, no, Bania, no. This is the dinner. The soup counts.
Good evening, folks. How you doing? (small reaction from the crowd) Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--
Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.
Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.
(Stops) Alright, that's not gonna work, it's not gonna work. Let me just think for a second here.
So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?
Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?
Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.
Well you're not even a fan. I was at game six - you didn't even watch it.
You faked it? Why would you do that?
If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.
Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? You know who these people are?
(determined) I wanna join. I need it to become a member.
You must have quite a time down there.
I never shouldve gotten involved in this. Im a nervous wreck. Im not cut out for investing.
People dont turn down money. Its what separates us from the animals.
So it had nothing to do with you.
Where have you been? You know, you're on next.
You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?
Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.
TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.
Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.
You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples clothes
Pull over? The lieutenant is waiting to see us.
Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?
All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I will give you double what you paid for it.
Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I never know what to write on these things. I hate doin' this.
So, can you believe that message? Now I?ve got to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up) Since I said what?
You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I give you 50 bucks.
I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.
(still in tuxedo, tie undone) Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building.
Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper of the Crusades, the development of the perforation, the first six-pack . . .
See I was saying "six" but she thought I was saying "sex". We straightened the whole thing out though.
Here he is... that's the guy! (rolls up window) No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back!
I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.
I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.
I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.
That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.
Okay, you tell me. What is it worth?
In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?
Yeah.. how about this I say "How's it goin'?"
What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?
Yeah, so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. I've shown I can go all the way.
I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.
Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab.
Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking.
You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?
(Trying to explain) Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your.. past.
Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!
So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.
I think I got David Duke and Farrakhan down there.
You want Little Jerry to take a dive?
So ah, what did you do last night?
No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.
See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.
Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?
So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.
So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. Its a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and Im supposed to feel bad. Is that the way its supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldnt you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. Cause its not easy to give someone the toe, youve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and... (Jerry pretends to drive with one foot in the air, giving the toe.) Look at that toe, buddy. (He puts his foot down.) I mean, thats really insulting to get the toe, isnt it?
So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?
yeah without a doubt, I'm down (Kramer enters) oh hey how're you doing? Jane this is my neighbor Kramer
Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I'm sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.
"Jimmy's got a record. Jimmy's jumping for dollars. Jimmt and George are gonna get rich."
I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.
Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain?
(While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!
First of all, I made plans with Elaine.
(Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!
No you go on ahead, I'll take the bus.
Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.
Your breath is fine. It's delightful, it's delicious.
I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.
Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?
Well, you want to sit with George? I think he's coming with Robin.
But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity.
Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*.
Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too.
Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.
(startled - eyes wide open) Hello, is somebody there? (scurrying sound) Mr.- Mr. Marbles?
She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.
Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.
No, I had to tell my friends  my friends didnt have to tell you.
(putting on his coat to go downstairs, he finds the key in his coat pocket) I believe this belongs to you.
how can u say things like that over the phone?
So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. It's sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in.
No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.
Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. who sacrifice so much for so long.
It's gotta have something to do with Kramer
Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Yknow Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, shes probably screamin at those aliens, I gotta have a lo mein!
The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.
No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your trouble..
Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.
You want to go with me to NBC?
That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.
I was an idiot for listening to you!
Oh of course. Todd Gack. You did you bet was in Star Wars? Sammy Davis Jr.
Well, her belly button is like a mouth. (doing the voice) Im bored. Talk to me.
You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field. (Phone rings, he answers it) Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. we're all set for the weekend.
Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm cold. Just give me a little squeeze.
That damn Mohel - he circumcised my finger! The Mohel circumcised my finger!
You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught.
Hey, I got a real thing about "shushing"!
He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris.
But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke.
A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. (Makes hand motions) Ho, ho, ho.
So this Da Vinci sleep is working out?
You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really... interesting. He would-
Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with you?
I couldnt tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that
Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?
hey where were you last night? I looked for you, I didn't see you
No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room.
Yeah, Ill have the egg salad on whole wheat.
Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.
Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?
That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?
Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.
Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.
Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? (Still ignores him) Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Yea nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you (woman turns around and notices him) oh well, what are you deaf?
Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this!
Hey, remember Beth and David from yesterday? They got separated.
No good. Too many people know the combination.
Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together.
Alright, I'm just joking. Listen, have a nice trip.
You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.
... as long as one of them is not him.
(on phone)Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.... it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then I'll come bye ok, bye.
Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.
Why do I always pay? What am I made of money? You bunch of deadbeats.
Wait a second! I never baited a hook with a rye before. Your hook is too small. This is for, like, a muffin. All right. Take it away.
Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage.
Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.
There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all sorts of... (he cracks) Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is it? What is it?!
Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?
But thats what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. Theyre knee- deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus.
So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they need keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going (mimics looking for keys) "Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again." They tell you it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system..."Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys to the plane in my apartment." You see the technicians all running underneath the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking for the magnet "hide-a-key" under the wing..."maybe he left it up there somewhere..."
What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?
Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you. Goodbye.
Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.
Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me.
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--
I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?
Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there's a chance they might somehow kiss.
Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth.
Oh, big fighting marlin. (Jerry acts like he is catching a marlin)
I don't know why he asked me to be the Godfather. We're not even that close of friends. Just cause we're on the softball team, I'm the pitcher, he's the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship?
He looks like you and he's working from the inside?
Have you ever spent any time with these people...?
Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your story's the one.
Uh, yeah. (broaching a subject) Hey uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't uh, rude to you that day I bumped into you on the street. Uh, I really did have to get to a meeting.
(to George) She thinks it's someone named Raef.
Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 650 AM tomorrow morning.
No, no Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.
What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight. (Hangs up)
If they were fanatic about showers, they might.
(Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.
Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.
Y-You didnt do anything. Its not you, its me. Its- this is very difficult.
I noticed she's big on the phrase "yada yada."
Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.
(getting looks from his parents) Not you. Older people.
And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!
That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.
No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
So know every time you get dressed. You are going to go down to the basement and use the dryer.
Hey. How would you like to go to the Super Bowl?
Why dont you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps.) Whats wrong?
That's right, Choochie. Let's see how Bania does without the cushy timeslot.
I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.
Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge `em.
No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake!
Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.
So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that...
(shakes his head) I'm very sorry. (closing the door on Phil. Jerry smiles and shrugs apologetically as Phil stares at them through the glass)
(still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?
Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it.
Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that!
He went crazy from one note. He couldnt get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized.
All right. But then I can't tell you the BIG news.
(Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.
Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.
You know what? It sounds like the friend of Elaine's that was hitting on me in the book store.
Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.
Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?
You can't just *have* an adultery-- you *commit* adultery. And you can't even *commit* adultery unless you already *have* a commitment. So you have to make the commitment before you can even think about committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery. Then you can get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But y'know some people actually *cheat* on the people that they're cheating with. Which is like, y'know, being in a hold up and then turning to the robber next to you and goin' Alright, gimme everything you have, too''.
Hey, could you do me a favour? [pause] Could you shut-up?
We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.
I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb! **
You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.
Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first thing they ask is who's responsible for this?
(fetching a drink from the fridge) Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money.
I'm in the book and I have a machine.
That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock?
to himself Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.
Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?
Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?
What do you mean not going? why not?
(walking away) Well, I didn't sleep with her.
Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.
A half hour, give me a half our.
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.
Of course I can, am I being funny now?
I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.)
By the way, just for the record -
(going through couch cushions) Where the hell did I put this?
Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR wants you to drop dead.
Turn up the heat in your apartment! (opens a window)
I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, Well, its ruined. And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, Its not our fault. Were not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation. You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? Theyre cleaning our clothes, but theyre not getting anything wet. Its all dry. I know theres gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that theyre using. Theres no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (Jerry brushes off his shirt.) Thats dry cleaning. I dont think thats what theyre doing back there. They dont have eighty guys going, Come on, hurry up! Theres a lot of shirts today!
It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker ...
She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...
(thinking) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty-nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume...
How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a minute. Poppy's from Tuscany. I'm gonna go call him.
Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.
I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited.
Whats the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!
No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.
What the hell are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be at work?!?
I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?
Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl. (pause) Did you?
(quietly, yet in a high and whiney tone) Well, I don't know if I....
I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel.
Kramer there's no way you stick to this.
You cant have that coat, it's not yours.
Why don't you go out? It's nice out.
You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't destroy someone else's.
Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.
You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.
Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.
Am I going? It was three nights ago.
(Gets up, and displays his own hands) Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.
Go? Why go anywhere? (as he places his hand over hers. She starts to massage his shoulders a little) Ahh, that feels good. Yeah. That's, uh... That's good. (he tries to go further. He grabs her hands over his shoulders and he lies down on the table on his chest) Yeah, that's nice. That's very nice.
Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (He closes the fridge.) And I cannot overstate this No soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear?
They guy's in my house right now. What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone.
Meat? I dont, I dont know, go... hunt! (Kessler opens the refrigerator and sticks his head in.) Well what happened in the game anyway?
You promise you'll never come in here again?
I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.
Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house  and then I saw it in your house.
Ah, she kinda calmed down. I talked to her today. In fact I'm gonna see her tonight.
I don't understand why we have to eat now.
[To Rep] I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.
Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.
You know what the odds are on a crash it's a million to one.
So tonight are you going to make the move?
I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.
Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there.
I dont return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.
I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.
Elaine. (Jerry puts his bags down, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote control and points it at the spot the TV usually occupies. The TV is not there. He continues to point the remote at random things around the room, searching for the TV.) ELAINE!
Hey! Is that Peter? ...I can't believe it. Get me a cup of Decaf. (leaves table)
I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here.
It's not that bright orange one is it?
See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.
Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?
You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
Well, theres this uh, woman might be comin in.
I'll get you another one just like it!
Yeah, I'm a very good boy. I'm flying down there and surprising him.
(to Elaine) Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?
Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.
What's going on? You're the man of the hour, That's what's going on.
He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about "Jerry."
He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man that's some tart cider!
Yknow, my parents are coming in for this...
Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.
This thing has never worked right. (holding the machine in his hand)
No, go ahead, I second-hand smoke two packs a day.
I know, I just can't bring myself to do it meanwhile that freezer keeps getting smaller and smaller (she smiles) (Elaine looks at her watch) oh, don't wanna keep Tony waiting
Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!
I'm sorry, Kramer. (he goes back to the kitchen)
But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.
So what are you going to do with the mattress?
Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would make fun of my name like you wouldn't believe-- "Jerry Jerry Dingleberry", and-hu "Seinsmelled"...
Theres the giant ball of oil. Clares right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!
Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. (They go out into the hallway and run into Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, Anna.) Hey, how ya doin.'
Oh, no, no, no, wait a second, wait a second th-th-that--
No, no Isabella's, I don't want to go to Isabella's.
Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other side.
(smiling with pleasure) You know, that almost makes this all worthwhile.
(Pulls a small bottle out of his pocket) Uh-huh. Hey, look what they had on the plane. Schnapps.
All right. As long as youre okay. Because I cant stop thinking about her.
I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...
Yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee)
Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! (George enters.)
Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land.
Where did you see that? Those are private!!!
So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor.
We're here discussing our script with your father.
What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?
Do you think this is such a good idea, with you being on the verge of this big promotion?
Uncomfortable? How does you think I feel?.. Hey let me ask you something, how much did you pay for that ticket?
Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just "recede into the night," if you know what I mean.
Ah, just remember when you see him tomorrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him.
Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses.
Thats the bet! (The phone rings; Jerry answers it.) Hello?... No- oh, hi... (Kramer leaves) no, they just left... Oh, my God... hang on a second. Maybe I can still catch em. (Jerry goes over to the window and opens it; calling out the window) Ma! Ma! Up here! Dont get in the cab! Manya died! Manya died!!
I dont know how Im going to tell him.
Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?
Do you even know what this scene is about?
Oh, no don't say that. You'll jinx me.
Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.
You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.
(indicating the woman) Game, set and match, huh Milos?
(checking his watch) I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.
How are we gonna get out of it?
Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment.
My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything?
The bags are in the car, I guess we better go.
(pulling on a jacket) They had a cancellation and they instantly called me.
Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didnt like the looks of the defense and changed the play.
Yeah, okay. (to Elaine) They may have found the car.
Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better.
Ah, you know. Im supposed to meet, eh, someone -- Ill, Ill wait for them outside. (walks towards the door)
(tucking in his shirt) Oh ya this is Rachel.
Gasoline? Can't you get it after you drop me off?
How can you think of food at the time like this?
Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?
What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?
Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now, and *demand* they pay for it.
No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.
Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!
Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He planned the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal.
I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...
It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. It got to me. And that orgasm stuff orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure!
Oh, like you know what you're talking about!
Why? I've got my cleaning before without a ticket.
Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.
You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner.
Keith Hernandez just asked me to help him move.
Yes. (To Jenny) You're sure there's nothing we can do?
I think that's it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing) Sweet fancy Moses!
They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out!
Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon?
I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?
Why can't you do this on your table?
Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!
Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing.
This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. The woman is absolutely mesmerizing.
I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?
I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.
Yeah I got it. You sure you want to do this? (hands Elaine the tape recorder.)
No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.
Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.
Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department.
I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on.
(Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.
Oh, w-what are you saying? So we're not going to go in there anymore?
Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone.
Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.
..except that the dude plays the showroom and I'm stuck doing food and beveridged!
All fathers are intimidating. Theyre intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, To hell with the world, I can make my own people. Ill eat whatever I want, Ill wear whatever I want, and Ill create whoever I want.
Ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves?
(Still ticked off) That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.
(thinking) Whats going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, shes too good to be alone. Whats the difference, I cant maneouver anyway with Elaine next to me.
See, never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.
I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.
What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.
You stuck your hand out, so I shook it. I don't know about a pact. Anyway, you should be happy you're engaged. You're getting married.
Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.
So I can see her tonight, and you dont care?
I tried putting her hands there (on his neck) but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it.
Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one.
Quone? No, Im afraid that Im going to have to challenge that.
Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you.
Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.
I'm right here. (note he has an athletic bandage on his right hand) You're late.
I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.
Did you look at look at this picture carefully?
I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
I don't know, 6-3, George, how tall is Kramer?
Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
(shaking his head no) No Kramer I don't want to talk to him.
I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.
I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off.
It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?
It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.
Well I, I can't believe this. I know Phil, he, he's a good friend of mine. We play softball together. How could this be?
Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his Visa's expired.
Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.
Aah, top of the fridge. Hey George, I'm taking that waitress to the Tony's.
It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.
All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.
How could you leave a message like that on my machine.?
(to Kramer) Thanks for that four a.m. wakeup call last night. (frustrated) Where the hell is that jacket?
Yeah. I want that coat. (Jerry opens his wallet, looking for the dry-cleaning ticket)
Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.
I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or somebody? What's with this guy? (Gino looks at him annoyed) Just asking.
Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?
Yeah.. I've been waitin' out their marriage for three years.
I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.
Yeah, so do you. (George enters with a newspaper.)
I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?
For some time... (video of Elaine dancing on the street with Jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.
(aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!
Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You cant do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over.
Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?
Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots!
This is Outrageous! (To Marcelino) Pack of Juicy Fruit.
Oh all right, this is really dumb, really stupid. Weve been doing this silly, dumb voice.
I don't care, why are you telling me this?
I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?
Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Giggio.
These are the receipts from 85 and I'm going to do 86.
I'm gonna call the cops. That?s what I?m doing, I?m calling the cops.
(picks up the phone on the coffee table) 555-3455. Well wait a second, don't you see that's 555-FILK.
I guess he failed to see the humor in it.
You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?
Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya doing?
Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes everything. I'd have to dress different. I'd have to act different. I'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and I'd need a new bedspread and new curtains I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting. I'd have to get new friends. I'd have to get orgy friends. ... Naw, I'm not ready for it.
I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train (yawns)
(thinking) So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?
(starts pulling them apart) Alright break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now (Kramer yells)
Kramer you're going to have to face her some time
Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.
Yeah, thats good. Hed clunk our heads together like Moe.
Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.
Hi. I..I was in the audience earlier. You threw my jacket down. I just wanted to pick it up.
All right, do you want the quarter, take the quarter, but don't try and tell me it's yours.
This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.
Yeah..... He caught me So here's what I want you to do. Come back with me to the store and we'll pretend to look at the coat.
It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?
Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi? Uh huh, really, uh, no problem, definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough.
Great, you're lonely and miserable again. (presses button to call elevator)
Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.
Ive been thinking about asking this girl Im, uh, seeing-
I don't have any change. You've got any change?
Oh really? (tries turning away in the hopes Elaine gets the hint; thinking) Oh God, I gotta get out of this.
Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--
That's it! No more questions! I don't care!
Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?
Elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man?
I like your nails, that is a great color.
I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.
You know, Gary (slams shut the door) I had a little chat with George the other day...
Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it.
Someone says, Get out of my life, and that doesnt affect your appetite?
STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) Do you believe this? Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house! He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw.
I didnt know. Kramer told me about the worlds.
(watching George buttoning his shirt) What is this?
No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.
