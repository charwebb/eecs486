Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!
George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.
Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long.
Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind.
"Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltezer after the salsa!"
Look at you, youre still thinking about it. Ill never feel comfortable.
Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?
Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.
Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it.
Yeah, but I'm a little uncomfortable. I'm afraid of making another mistake.
What's going on? You're the man of the hour, That's what's going on.
so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?
Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal [and, ala Carson] Wild, Wild, Stuff...
Kramer there's no way you stick to this.
While you were in jail. So you're free.
You didn't like that crack about the pen.
Hey. How would you like to go to the Super Bowl?
Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.
No you go on ahead, I'll take the bus.
I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat.
(interrupts) What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll make an appointment for a doctor today. (on the phone) Hello? Oh hi! I'm sorry. No, that's my next door neighbor. He's not quite himself. He got kicked in the head. What? Really? You're kidding! Today? Yeah! Sure! We could make it. Two o'clock? Yeah, we would do that. Okay. Great! Thanks a million! Okay, bye.
(Following Leo out the door) Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!
No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.
I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.
I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.
Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--
Schumann. (George stops himself, frightened. Jerry looks around the lobby.) Where are they?
Why would he steal a box of raisins?
How do you make sure your gonna get to the third date?
Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees!
Who takes care of your boy during the day?
Ah, actually, I ka, kinda had some things to do.
Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking.
Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
Well, said he was waiting about two hours. Seemed a little put out.
Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers...
Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. Its completely shrunk. Theres absolutely no way I can wear it.
(removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?
(touching the back of his neck) It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here.
May I see you outside for a moment please?
Your name is a good name, Costanza. Sounds like it's stands for something, they'll believe us.
Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater.
hey, uh.. (Kramer walks around a little) what'd you get there?
(sarcasm) Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower.
Hey you know when Superman saves someone no one asks if he's trying to hit on her!
Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?
(to Elaine, still joking) He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce!
Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual.
I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction, let's just eat popcorn or something.
Im just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure.
A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning..
Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom, soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes.
What is that stench? I got it. (He follows the smell to Kramers door) Ah hah.
Oh Yeah we went way out and wild.
Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again? (listens) Oh really? Well you can't break up with me over the phone. C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me. (hurriedly) Why d'you wear the same dress all the time? Hello.
She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.
George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?
You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.
...main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet, is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, "Here's my cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now." "This is my dog. He died during the Johnson administration." You know. You get stopped by a cop, no licence, no registration, (waves imaginary wallet) "Here's fifty-six people that know me." Cop goes. "Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check."
Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)
Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here.
Wait a minute! (A manic chase scene ensues, with Jerry chasing Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.)
Well thank you very much, it's about time.
She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective?
All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you.
So, ah, what are you doing around here Ramon?
Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?
Really? (They start to make out, Jerry sees the pilot on the plane) Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!
(To Guard) I just wanted you to scare him.
Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. who sacrifice so much for so long.
No, it&Mac226;s, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. i...
I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.
Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I save them.
Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...
Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. (George laughs) So, when do you move into the apartment?
Well let me ask you this. What exactly did you say when you asked her out?
She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.
You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head.
(Smiling, like a salesman) All right. Now, what do I have to do to put you two in a relationship today?
Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?
So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table
So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.
Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.
I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and I were just taking about the big race.
I think I offended the wake-up guy...! (worried)
I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a coffee table.
Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)
The whole thing was taking out of context. It was a joke. (The phone rings.) Thats probably Uncle Leo.
Okay, Okay, I promise. (puts on the headphones again) Wow!!! Oh Man...Oh God.. Oh Brother....Whoooaaaa!! Whoaaaa (Elaine enters he takes them off rapidly)
So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is--
I was an idiot for listening to you!
Its very good cantaloupe. (Kramer leaves; to George) So thats it? Youre out?
Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into contact with --
All right, all right. (trying on the suit jacket)
"Wait a second ..Where you wearing those shoes in the cab?"
She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.
Listen, Matthew, I-I want to explain something to you. Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do.
Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office.
What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him, I dont think were right for each other. Hes a guy! At least with a woman, theres a precendent. You know, the relationship goes sour, you end it.
No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.
Hey, is that my maple syrup? Oh, ya. (Kramer hands it over.)
(Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.
Ah, no wonder we're getting so much rain.
Oh well if it isn't Shakey the Mohel! Nice job on the circumcision but it's not supposed to be a finger.
Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you.
..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.
..She was sitting at the table where I had my tape recorder...Okay great. Thanks again.. bye. HA Ha..Who do these women think they're dealing with? Did she think she was gonna leave this incredibly erotic message on my tape and I was just gonna let it go. Not Bloody likely...
Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse.
Well, look at this guy. Look, hes got everything, hes got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners.  This is not his first load.
But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment shes going right for that machine.
Its a list of excuses, its for that guy, Horneck, whos at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I dont have to see him. (Elaine laughs.) I need it. (Elaine starts writing on the list.) What are you doing?
Ok, great, well, I'm glad everything worked out, Babu.
(pulling on a jacket) They had a cancellation and they instantly called me.
You know last time you had me throwin' a rye bread up three floors to you, now you want me to go up to the Bronx, take flyers off your car, where does it end?!?
Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. >click click<
George, I didnt sleep at all last night. I decided I have to tell her. Im just going to be honest. Thats all... Yes, Im nervous... Are you listening to me?... Just put some soap on your finger. Itll slide right off... Then try axle grease... (Kramer enters; to the phone) Ill call you back after I talk to her... Bye.
All right, I'll do it. (Goes on stage) Hey kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your home! (Audience boos)
Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I, guess she passed out!
Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.
Yes, but lets just stop it right there.
(putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back to Sopie's) Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship.
(To George) Hey, any luck? Did you catch 'em?
(To Kramer) Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car. (Gestures to a black Saab)
(to George) Snow. Snow, that cant be good for suede, can it?
...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Lemme tell you something if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. You're not going to be needing those for awhile, either.
Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.
My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didnt want to move to Florida, but theyre in their sixties, and thats the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old peoples house with a golf cart, jump out, Lets go Pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there. Drop it! I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversations so boring. Its so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, What if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the glass. You know. Come back in, theres broken glass, everybodys all upset. No, Im all right. I was just a little bored there. And uh no, Im fine. I came back. I wanted to hear a little more about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Lets pick it up right there.
I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I dont get this. Arent cows outside most of the time? I dont understand it. When its raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, Let us in, were all wearin leather. Open the door! Were gonna ruin the whole outfit here! Is it suede? I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I cant have this cleaned. Its all I got!
(about the massage)You know I think this is really helping.
Well, the pickle breath is a good start.
Got lost? We went to school here for three years.
Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, "Oh. Tube socks." What are you gonna do about it?
Is that guy still there? (They are side-on to Phil who is in the background, still pressed against the glass, aghast)
I would know if I had a blender.
Alright, I'm gonna get this. This looks good.
(pulling Leo back in) Hang on a second. I got a little proposition for you.
I didn't make a deal. I just shook your hand.
Yeah, he's disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV)
.. and uh, underwear and a tee shirt.
I dont know, I don't feel so good.
The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.
Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and eighty-three people?
What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.
Yeah, I blamed it on you. Hi Tim.
Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!
Yea, ya, so...anyway what was I talking about.
"Did you notice he always refer to himself in the third person. Jimmy can dunk. Jimmy's new in town. Jimmy we'll see you later."
And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess? That's pretty sick.
Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?
I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.
Oh right, the new job, how is it?
Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.
Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford. I'm calling Beth tonight, and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you do likewise.
So you want me to get the books? Is that it?
Well, its a new suede jacket. It might get ruined.
Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. (Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks at Kramer.)
Get in there. (he pushes George in the direction of the restaurant)
Shes waking down the street and it hit her in the head!
So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?
(Rubbing it in) Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything?
Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, you were right. I'll do anything!
This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit?
I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show.
Uh, hang on a second, You know what? Changed my mind, make it a tuck.
Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...
I might need you to get me a soda.
See, I don't get that. First they come out with the regular, then a year later they come out with the cherry. They know that we like the cherry, start with cherry! Then come out with the regular!
What do you mean they're not going to do anything, they're the cops, they gotta do something, he just put the kibosh on me, do you know what the kibosh means, its a kibosh!
Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?
Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story.
Well, thats it. You two are back together.
I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?
We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC.
I'm not sure, but I think she was nice. (takes a sip of water)
I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?
Well it?s very flattering. How did you get these tickets, I heard they're impossible to get.
No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.
I just hope that whole pony incident didnt put a damper on the trip.
Oh why don't you go sleep over at Newman's.
I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? (Kramer comes in) A real dermatologist.
Ah, you must be Kramer's guys. (indicating) Come on in. You got the cigars?
Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern!
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
Got it. (but now a man-hand grabs his arm) Uh!
Well be sure to catch a Broadway show while you're in town.
Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.
(To George, in a 'cha-ching!' motion) Vermont! (To Ellen) With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to! (George is disturbed. He gets up, goes go Kramer's door, and knocks. They talk) Four days at a beautiful bed-and-breakfast! I can't wait.. buy-bye. (Hangs up. George and Kramer come into Jerry's apartment, confronting him) What? (George takes the phone off the hook) What is this?
Come on, take them. You could take Bonnie.
If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen.
What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.
Well, maybe we should just forget about the cake?
That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.
(Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..
Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up. (Kramer goes to get the suit. Elaine enters.)
Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets.
Uhn-uh-uhn - Uhn-uh-uhn - - veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer A-Ha ha! Mission accomplished! Back to base, Joe. (singing) dee, de-de, de-de-de-de-de (Makes G.I. Joe swim off, legs kicking)
You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?
All right. As long as youre okay. Because I cant stop thinking about her.
(Obviously mad at the situation he's in) 'Why am I wearing is now?? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why! And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her!
Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you dont have to be home on time.
Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it, Kramer.
I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!
You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.
Actually, yeah. (Pause) Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?! (Dramatically) Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?!
Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.
I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce you get impeached and you're not even the president!
I mean I met her three times. I dont even know her last name.
You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD!
(mind's voice) Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?
Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews.
This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George.
I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!
Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay?
Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways.
(Nodding) Yes. Yes I am. (Kramer chuckles) Master of my domain. But I will tell you this I am going over to (Gestures to the nudist) her apartment, and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down!
If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen.
Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Uh, gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. Alright let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... (looks at Joe; Joe gives him a weird look)ooo, just right... and three plantains uh ought to do it.
Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? Im sorry. I didnt mean it. I took it out on you. Were still friends. Were still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look, Ill tell you what. Ive got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on.
George, here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated.
"Don't you see what's happened, he couldn't talk , he's wearing these shoes, he's drooling."
It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.
Have you noticed people staring at your head?
Oh, just keep your voice down. Everyone can hear you.
(TO GEORGE) Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?
-programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were here, I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'
I didn,t tell you to park in that lot .. Now someone's gonna have to drive you every time you need your car.? Take the bus!
My honest opinion, I think she made it up.
(Still ticked off) That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.
No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.
So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, I gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didn't?
All right now you listen and you listen good! (he grabs Kramer's legs and throws him down the couch)
He asked you to watch them not wear them.
(thinking) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty-nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume...
Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about that?
I feel terrible. (Kramer smiling) I mean, Ive seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I cant go any further, but... Shes just got this like, psychosexual hold over me. I just want her, I cant breathe. Its like a drug.
Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.
I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.
Actually, I was thinking of donating a large portion of it to charity.
You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.
I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.
Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?
You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldnt expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand.
I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath.
Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.
You know I don't even know why I brought you.
Ah. But they told us we must go now.
Dont worry about it, it wasnt working anyway.
They sell them by the side of the road. Blueberry, Blackberry ....
Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.
Oh, you want to try the syrup! (Meryl smiles and takes it. The waitress comes over.)
So why don't they talk like that now?
Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?
Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper said he would put me up for membership.
Yeah, I took her home one night  we kinda started up a little bit in the car.
Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature Channel.
Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.
Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone.
Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess youre not going in anymore.
That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what is this?
But there's no "t" in your name. What about G-bone?
Yeah, and, (Pointing to his watch) because of the.. (Slowly exiting) time.
No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.
Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.
Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.
It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache everything. He's all smooth now. Look's like a seal.
she's one of these people, always have to be different
Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?
I don't need a personal trainer. (Kramer comes in) all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later.
Now there's a match. You and Katherine Hepburn.
You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?
Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona, how does that hurt me?
No, hes It. He wins. It is good.
Who figures and immigrants gonna have a pony?
all right lets be reasonable, Bania. Im taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think it's a pretty good deal.
(pause) I don't know, they just tell you the night before.
Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes everything. I'd have to dress different. I'd have to act different. I'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and I'd need a new bedspread and new curtains I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting. I'd have to get new friends. I'd have to get orgy friends. ... Naw, I'm not ready for it.
(firmly matter-of-fact) Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.
You raise the feet, get blood to the head.
I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent.
(impressed) Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.
That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!
Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream.
Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the, uh...
Thirty-six. What's the signal? Howbout this? Chicken wing? No, no, no, I got a better one. Head patting.
Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.
Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)
There's nothing pleasant about it, so lets just cut the crap.. You gave me fleas. I know it and you know it..
If they were fanatic about showers, they might.
(he hits a few keys and looks over at her) Cash advance... yes (hits a key)  no (he looks over again) balance inquiry... no (he looks again) receipt.... no (he looks again) processing... processing... (He opens the box, pulls out his money and then looks at the woman and says) I won!
Well, I didnt uh really mean a pony, per se...
Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out. (pretends to pull hair out)
Great, I had fun. Wheres the TV, wheres the VCR?
Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs.
Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?
All right come on in. ... Just wait over HERE! Just wait here and I'll get it for you. ... Kramer this is Tia.
If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like Lex Luthor.
OK, wait a second, wait a second, what happened to my papers?
Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?
For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.
He asked me if I was doing anything Friday night.
Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.
Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for it.
Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!
These are the receipts from 85 and I'm going to do 86.
(Joking about the bra-less wonder) Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support.
So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.
What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.
So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.
So Kramer, what are you going to do?
Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
So have your parents found out about it?
Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! (Kramer enters.)
Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Giggio.
Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?
No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him.
It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.
Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that Bosco bit then you got your Nestl's Quik bit, by the time you get to Ovaltine--
Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!
That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.
(Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.
My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back on. (Kramer enters with a bucket and starts filling it with water on the sink) Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock.
Let me explain something to you. You see, youre not normal. Youre a great guy, I love you, but youre a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldnt understand.
Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!
When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion.
Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday.
No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up, hes treatin me just like a regular customer, now!
But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.
Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was that?'
Well, what d'you think the hoboes are doing?
You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes.
(to Kramer) ...( words missing)...laugh , everything's nice and at the end of the night I go for a little contact. I get the PULL BACK. This woman said the filthiest things I've ever heard in my life. I get the Pull Back.
He could have said "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.
I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.
I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there.
Well, you know; not everything. I do what I can.
Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.
Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean izz-it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. You know, cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell.
Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should really be fun.
Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.
Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.
Hey what about Dr. Resnick My Uncle Leo is going to see him tomorrow .
So, its okay? I could just tell her she can have it?
(thinking; quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.
Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-
He used to go there a lot on business.
I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!
Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.
Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic.
Can you relax, its a cup of coffee. Claire is a professional waitress.
Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - (reads comedy he's written) "Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest."
You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the Chinese restaurant is! I mean, aren't we all getting a little too sensitive? I mean, someone asks me which way is Israel, I don't fly off the handle.
(determined) I wanna join. I need it to become a member.
I actually met her a few weeks ago, but... (Jerry stops, and mentally visualizes George telling Susan about how Jerry got Lena's number from the AIDS list...then Susan passing the information along to Monica on the phone at work.)
But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people.
Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?
Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
You want food, don't cha? (nodding his head up and down)
I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.
Hey! Same initials . How do you like that?
I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.
I think we might have one left in the stock room.
All right, I'll call 911. Think he did it? Could've he done it? Couldn't done it? How could've he done it? Couldn't be? Could it? Hello 911? How are you? I'm sorry it was just a reflex...I know it's an emergency number...it is an emergency...my friend is being accused of being a smog strangler and I know he didn't do it...they're putting me trough to the detective in charge of the investigation...what is my name? Who am I? I'm eh...George Costanza...
Ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from Florida.
You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.
Now thats not fair! So where did you meet this guy?
I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation.
Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food.
Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have any conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.
It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that...
U-oh come on up. (buzzes them up) It's Elaine you don't have a problem with her do you?
(To Elaine) It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's unconscious.
It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom)
Why would I freak out? (To himself) Pilot...
Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.
I... uh....promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her.
I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night only, the big screen. My hands are tied!
Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.
That was a one in a million Mohel.
Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know its missing, and he took it! And of all things to take! I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. Hes crazy.
It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors.
No, cab's comin' in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.
Why don't you go out? It's nice out.
Yeah. What's wrong, why? ( George runs back to the bathroom)
Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.
(Still going along with the practical joke) You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?
Oh, that guy was your cousin! (walking in front of George so he gets the picture to leave)
Hey, when Im driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. Im always waving everybody in. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. ...All right. All right. Ill have a chicken salad.
Elaine? How did you rope her into this?
Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.
Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me.
Welcome everyone to the room...Ah, the extra button....yeah ... what kind of a sicko would save these ...have them in a huge file, drawers that wide (small fingers opening imaginary drawers) Where the hell is that ... I mean is it THAT hard to get round black buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like this? ... is it such a great jacket ... the buttons are so unique, so one of a kind, you'll never find them - they save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know they're going to fall off too that's the other thing ...
I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.
Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?
You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the "Astonishing Tales of Costanza".
Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable.
September 21st, first day of Autumn. Leaves changing colours.. Beautiful colors.
(to George) He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.
But if you go back with me , then I'm not.
(reading) 'I, Cosmo Kramer, having just seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness, and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie, hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine, lung-blower, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.'
(acting like he was walking on stage) Hey how ya doing? Good to be here.
Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones.
Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it.
You can't put a paper towel on his head.
I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens answer the door...)
So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul.
(to himself) I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles. (answers phone) Hello.
It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.
No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute.
(thinking) Well, the drive home should be a delight. Im speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I dont care. (to Vanessa) That's the manager? Do you want me to see if we can get another room?
I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space.
Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.
Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer!
1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass!
Anyway, I don't need your help. (Turns to leave.)
Yeah, well that relationships really got a lot of potential.
Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?
All of a sudden it hit me, I realized what the problem is; I can't be with someone like me.. I hate myself!! If anything I need to get the exact opposite of me....It's too much. It's too Much I can't take it ...I can't take it!!!
'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?
Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.
(Stunned) No, keep it. (Elaine enters the apartment) Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.
No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?
No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o.
Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.
Y-You didnt do anything. Its not you, its me. Its- this is very difficult.
(as Ping rambles on ) ...S'cuse me (Ping looks up) Kind of an expensive call.
Yep. Since college. (Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.) Hey, Lena Small's on this list.
Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?
Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit.
Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything unusual about it.
But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.
Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight. Let's live a little. .
Yeah. Im having a wonderful time. (it's obvious he isn't)
George used up all my guest passes already.
What should I do? (to Alton) Uh, were taking a cab, arent we?
C'mon, you lost your wallet, I figured I'd get you another one.
You were livin' in the village then, right?
Well you might as well look it over.
Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.
What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?
Yeah, uh, Ok, uh, tomorrow uh, where da ya - where do you live, uh, up town? Upper west side?
Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that guy, he just came in.
Why should I have anything for say for myself?
Uh, how about a couple of people like us.
Yeah, you're right. It's just a natural human function...happens to be on my sofa, instead of in the toilet, where it would normally be.
Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse.
That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves, as a result of contact.
You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. (Picks up the phone.) She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number...
Hey,that might be a nice idea for George's wedding.
Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!
You should have her work on it for you.
But they not you arent handicapped, arent you ashamed?
Look I really don't know what they're plans are.
Hey, thanks a lot for lettin' me stay here.
Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact, even some of them have moved on - theyre doing sign language now.
Naw, I gotta wait until its just the right time.
No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg creams) You gotta put the syrup in first.
Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office
Why? I've got my cleaning before without a ticket.
I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation. The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, "You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?"
So, uh, whats your son doing now, Dr. Stevens? Oh, hes a public fornicator. Yes, hes a fine boy...
I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!
I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place, but that couldn't be.
Well, wouldn't I have to be? You tell me there's a can opener in the drawer, I'm looking in the drawer, there's no can opener - what other conclusion could one reach? (The phone rings.)
In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?
I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!
You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had my chance and that's that.
A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name?
What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started screaming "There he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!" And then, when they all run into the other direction, we'll jump in the car!
Wait a second, you got the Mark McEwan TV Guide.
Ramon, what are you doing here? You could get in trouble.
So forget about the books. Did you read them?
I am not gonna taste your peach. I ate some one's pecan last night, I'm not gonna eat your peach.
It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.
Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.
I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot.
If there's a serial killer lose in your neighborhood, it seems like the safest thing is to be the neighbor. They never kill the neighbor. The neighbor always survives to do the interview afterwards. Right? "Oh, he was kind of quiet." I love these neighbors. They're never disturbed by the sounds of murdering, just stereo. Chain saws, people screaming, fine. Just keep the music down. And all these women who always fall in love with the serial killer. They write to him in prison. Here's a woman that's hard to disappoint. I guess she's only upset when she finds out he's stopped killing people and she goes "You know sometimes I feel like I don't even know who you are anymore".
(Reading words George wrote on his hand) "Matthew, Luke, Paul", what youre cheating on your conversion chest?
So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D?
He wants me to set him up with this girl, Nina Stengal.
Hey...I'm not stupid. I'm looking in that drawer, there's no can opener.
Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.
So when somebody has B.O., the "O" usually stays with the "B". Once the "B" leaves, the "O" goes with it.
(watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans?
Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.
(to Kramer) Hey (snaps fingers) get your stuff, let's get going.
(trying to ease the tension) Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends.
So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise?
Well, I don't think I want to date a protg whose mentor is a Costanza.
Why can't I buy my father a car?
Pull over? The lieutenant is waiting to see us.
Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?
Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I *knew* you looked familiar!
Oh, I see. So you can go, "Hey, you know who I saw wilding today? Herb!"
Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian.
Why, you don't think it's a good job?
Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?
Why didn't you just ask her for it?
(taking the envelope) Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign 'em.
(finding Frankie, in his hole) Frankie... come on out of there.
Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a person could still make a mistake like that.
Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.
The crook has the machine. The messages arent for him. Hes the crook. Why would he answer- (Jerry gives up on the explanation and turns around to see George standing behind him.) How did you get in here?
Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?
It's Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something.
Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet.
Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.
I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited.
I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee.
See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. (George enters) Hey George, look, I'm not funny now.
Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up...
Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!
Hang on a second. (handing Morty the phone) Dad it's Klompus.
Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole.
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?
(jumps in surprise) Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be gone.
You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world.
I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight.
I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.
OK, fine. 'What do I have to do to put you in this van today?'
But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!
What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.
They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives.
Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.
Why dont you ask that doctor what it is?
Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?
I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.
Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.
(yelling) Yes I told him the Packyderm story!
Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.
So listen, I gotta go down to Atlantic City. I'm performing at Bally's.
Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.
Maybe I didnt want to talk to him.
You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. "Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies." So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin them whenever I want!
Well, I'm no genius but, according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.
Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's with you?
(Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.
Got 'em on the street, from a scal... (catches himself again)
Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?
Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you?
Im meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop.
(animated) You know, I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because I thought you knew what you were talking about.
You cannot buy half a can of soda.
Ahh, we waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??... Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women!
Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?
So, um, do you date uh immature men?
Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!
You know I dont get that whole suicide machine. Theres no tall buildings where these people live? They cant wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?
Well, I painted my apartment again. Ive been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, its a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize its just the thickness of the paint, but Im aware of it. It just coming in and coming in. Every-time I paint it, its closer and closer. I dont even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. Thats where I plug in. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control... Thats why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurtling through space in your living room, watching TV. Thats why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen. They came over Friday nights, Klingon boxing, gotta be there.
I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me.
(Sarcastic) Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.
They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) "What do they look like."
I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and Ill just make up some excuse why I cant go to the game either.
Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George.
I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!
How could she say that on TV?.. And how did she get a cable special . I 've never gotten a cable special.....well that's it I'm not giving her any more material. We are incommunicado. (to the silent Kramer on the couch beside him) ...Exactly.
Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) How ya doing?
Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said "Too bad he's gay".
It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?
First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, "Didn't you see my signal?" "Look at that fender!" ..Then you'd see a real fight.
Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.
We come up with all these stupid reasons to break up with these women.
I'll pick you up at your apartment. We'll go to the Eight.
No good. Too many people know the combination.
(Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.
So you'll just explain to him you're not a Communist. You just called the woman for a date.
You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley.
Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore...
I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train (yawns)
It would be nice to care about someone.
Jenna's like me. She's very... (searches for word)
Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.
I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?
This stuff on top is my friends. Could I get it done in a separate machine?
He's got like a chemical imbalance. He needs to be on medication.
Oh, w-what are you saying? So we're not going to go in there anymore?
Quone? No, Im afraid that Im going to have to challenge that.
(outraged) He's a doctor!.I mean it's supposed to be like a sterile environment."
See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.
If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.
I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over.
Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned it...
(To bartender) Can I have a club soda? (To Ronnie) Goin' on tonight?
I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, Well, its ruined. And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, Its not our fault. Were not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation. You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? Theyre cleaning our clothes, but theyre not getting anything wet. Its all dry. I know theres gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that theyre using. Theres no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (Jerry brushes off his shirt.) Thats dry cleaning. I dont think thats what theyre doing back there. They dont have eighty guys going, Come on, hurry up! Theres a lot of shirts today!
That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?
Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go.
Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.
Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the farm.
I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door)
Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --
(to Ramon) Oh. Okay. (to Elaine) Wh, what is he doing here?
(Takes the ticket back and looks at it, flips it over) The dry-cleaning numbers are gone too.
My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. He was with Brant-Leland for a while.
All right, all right. All right, thats enough! Lets get back to my deal. That undercoating, thats a rip-off, isnt it, David?
I have an idea. (Elaine enters; to Elaine) We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema Three.
What's the difference? I agreed to wear it. It's - it's a puffy shirt. I feel ridiculous in it, and I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever seen, to be perfectly honest with you. (Nodding)
Thats what you want to see, yeah. . . . Yeah, you want to trade your hair for some phlegm.
Oh, hi. I-I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I'm movin' in. I saw your name on the buzzer - You must be Kessler.
I'm going to the hospital, to visit Fulton.
Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab.
(reaching into his pocket) Alright, I'll give you nine thousand for it.
You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?
"They get all emotional , they sway. It's embarrassing."
What about this? This is blood isn't it?!
All right. Now you're doing something to help me. (to the phone) Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot. (hangs up)(to George) Casting tomorrow at NBC. 400. We're in business baby, the pilot's on. You're gonna successful. (George looks disappointed)
Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.
The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.
So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.
(Stops pulling on the pants) Alright, alright, That's no good. (Moves Kramer over to the couch) Let me try getting them from the bottom. (Goes for Kramer's Leg) Just gimme one leg.
Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car?
He asked me to. We were getting along.
I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth.
Oh no! >click click< Kramer, this phone's a piece of junk, goodbye!
Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?
Come on. I don't want to tag along with George and Susan. If you're there it'll be a better group.
I can't figure out what's going on here. I can't follow the plot. Why did they kill that guy? I thought he was with them?
[whispering] No, no news. You better get out of here.
George, I am loving this no wallet thing.
When you ask someone about their relationship and they touch their face, you know it's not going too well. Go ahead ask me how it's going with somebody.
Oh my god! Look what's goin' on here! She is depraved! (Grabs a towel and brings it to Lena.) There you are.
(adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.
Hey! Is that Peter? ...I can't believe it. Get me a cup of Decaf. (leaves table)
That's always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus?
I've gotta to tell you about existence of egg salad?
Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee?
I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.
Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles...
For some time... (video of Elaine dancing on the street with Jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.
You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.
You know, I don't even know my IQ.
You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won!
Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.
I guess he failed to see the humor in it.
Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.
I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man.
Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out..
I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate.
Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the couch?
All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything.
What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present)
