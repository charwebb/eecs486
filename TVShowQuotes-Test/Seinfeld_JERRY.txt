Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And Ill need that in the form of a question.
Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life? he's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he's made out of wood an' he can spin his head around, we're somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren't noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they? they're just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know? you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. Ya think 'I don't think this thing is real.'
Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!
You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months.
Who, who, who do you think would win in a fight between me and ah, gorgeous George here. (pointing up and down at George)
Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Caf Latte?
She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her. I mean it was "Beaches" for god's sake. What, what do you do in a situation like that?
Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?
Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.
[whispering] No, no news. You better get out of here.
Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.)
I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?
Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?
So were in the room and shes trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.
"Yeah!!! What is that? I mean isn't that sick. I mean , I'd be embarrassed to have that in my apartment."
Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle?
Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes.
(moving over to block the door) Where are you going?
Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??... Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women!
Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it.
Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. >click click<
oh! that's it I'm gonna put an end to this.
Wow! Zanadu . No wonder youre putting in so many hours. (looks at urinal) May I?
Yes I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's condition...
And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. (Waitress comes to table)
To wash my hands. Theyre sticky from the orange.
I don't understand. What don't you like about it?
Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?
Well it?s very flattering. How did you get these tickets, I heard they're impossible to get.
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--
I dont know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three oclock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someones door and tell them to keep it down? Youre really altering your whole self-image. I mean, what am I, Fred Mertz now? Whats happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. Theres a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. Shh... shh... shhh... shhh... Doesnt work, cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a shh. Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me. Some people you cant shush in a movie theater. Theres always that certain group of people, isnt it? Theyre talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They wont shush. Theyre the unshushables.
Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night.
I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!
Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight.
(to Mickey) Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you?
Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache everything. He's all smooth now. Look's like a seal.
Are you sure he cant hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.
What do you say to a person like you?
Yeah... hes specializing in whales. He's working on lowering the cholesterol level, in whales all that blubber -- quite unhealthy. You know its the largest mammal on earth but as George says "they don't have to be."
No body said youre fat. Hes a loving character, like the Kool-ade guy.
(walking out) Thanks for having me over, guys.
(Pats George on the back) Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining room doorway) I think the busboy's in trouble.
Excuse me, um, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here earlier today crumpled up like a napkin?
This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.
I mean that's fine if that's who you are...
So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?
(Sarcastically) Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.
Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.
(Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..
What, you got a problem with the pen now?
You know why? Because people like to say "salsa." "Excuse me, do you have salsa?" "We need more salsa." "Where is the salsa? No salsa?"
Who would order a license plate that says "Assman"?
I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand.
Kramer!? (grabbing Kramer's arm roughly, pulling him back as he's about to knock)
(spits the nut) OooH!!! You. you ate these? You sucked on these and put them on the plate?
No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him.
I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?
We're here discussing our script with your father.
Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled.
How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a minute. Poppy's from Tuscany. I'm gonna go call him.
(to Elaine) I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman catalog. (to George) Get this one "I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours later, lost in the fiord, a welcoming smile. Thank god she spotted the epaulettes on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest".
Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her Im sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.
Well, You can't go in there it's like a gas chamber in there.
Oh, I cant. Uh, I have a tendency to get chilly.
I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
How much money is this gonna cost me?
(after the guy) You think you're better than me?
Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.
Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.
Wh..why didn't you tell me before you sold it?
Y-You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout the whole set!
Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time.
It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.
Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.
Well, what's to be said? He didn't remember you.
Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that price?
I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!
(Pulls the note out of his pocket) That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so funny?! ..That's not funny.. There's nothing funny about that.
No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.
Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?
(standing) Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours. (indicates Buddy) You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track.
I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? "Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!"
Ah, don't worry. I made reser... (catches himself)
I am not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to say t-the franks and beans for example.
How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?
Alright, sit down, sit down. (Grabs a pill from the bottle, and starts advancing tward Kramer - like an owner with his dog)
You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.
You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?
Wait 'til I tell him about the book.
Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?
So you were talking, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") you're having pleasant conversation, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") then all of sudden...
I mean I'm happy sometimes, but-but not now.
Blow it off. Remember Poli Sci? How many of those did we go to?
Just go back and ask him again. (Slams the door on Kramer)
So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.
No, It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to New York a few years ago . she's trying to become an actress.
Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.
Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? What did I do?
Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night.
I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.
Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.
She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either.
I don't know, opera, it?s not my kind of thing.
"I think that's eat 24 hours before surgery."
You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley.
I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot.
12 gauge. Seems to be the most popular gauge.
Oh really? (tries turning away in the hopes Elaine gets the hint; thinking) Oh God, I gotta get out of this.
C'mon up. (Slightly opens the door for Elaine)
Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.
I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.
Course we have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation.
All right lets go. We'll meet you back down here in ten minutes, hopefully with the money.
Hear that? Guess who's back. (Opening the door) Hey!
Uh huh. Well uh, I'll give you a call, and thanks for the fish. By the way, you know why fish are so thin?
I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.
Anyway, I don't need your help. (Turns to leave.)
And what about yooou?!? Tryin' to bilk an innocent bystander out of a family fortune, built on sweat and toil, manufacturing quality O'Henry candy bars, for honest, hard-working Americans!
Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. who sacrifice so much for so long.
I don't have to be funny, I don't care.
You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?
Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt.
Maybe I didnt want to talk to him.
(Stops) Alright, that's not gonna work, it's not gonna work. Let me just think for a second here.
Whats with the pink lining and the candy stripes?
First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.
I just hope that whole pony incident didnt put a damper on the trip.
It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.
Right in the head! (leans in and points at Testikov)
yeah without a doubt, I'm down (Kramer enters) oh hey how're you doing? Jane this is my neighbor Kramer
Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you. Goodbye.
You're lucky they let you drive a car.
Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries.
You're going to make a good father someday.
I mean, Bozo the Clown...I mean does he really need "the clown" in his title, as clown? Bozo, "the" clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo...
I cant blame you. I cant believe she never called you back.
So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?
Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.
All right, she said she couldnt find a decent hotel room...
Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I like that.
Why'd you have to say anything to her?
Well, look at this guy. Look, hes got everything, hes got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners.  This is not his first load.
It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.
Yeah, big missing goin' on (spreads arms wide)
I was an idiot for listening to you!
It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.
Because you know we used to go out.
Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.
I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)
Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.
Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving.
Aww, right. Three hundred, plus fifty for the repair. Three fifty, that's it!
Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something. You sure you wanna go through with this?
I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday.
All right. But then I can't tell you the BIG news.
Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye (hangs phone up)
No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing. (Jerry picks up the phone and dials the number) I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?
Kramer, you've been arrested as a serial killer!
You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when you're happy.
Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!
(motions of making out) Well you were involved in some sort of amorous...
Uh, Along long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.
Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now.
You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are.
So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing.
"Just one....gotta go back.....Oh but get this. Elaine, you will appreciate this. I'm sitting in Tim Whatley's waiting room...He's got a Penthouse right out on the table."
Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot.
Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.
I bought you a Cadillac. (hands over the keys) Here you go.
(a la "Don Corleione") Elaine, never ask me about my business!.... (SHEEPISH) "Godfather."
(indicates with his thumb) Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.
You know, what you need is a song you can share.
All right. That's it, I can't work like this.
Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?
No Elaine he's normal. Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York.
There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that...
So how come you're not going over there for dinner?
Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.
Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?
No, Uncomfortable? Not at all. (ASIDE TO ELAINE) My friend's wife's breast sticking out - why would that make me uncomfortable?
Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line.
50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.
Hey. It's you! (pointing) Th..that's my Friars Club jacket!
All right, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous. Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now.
No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!
"I dunno how you could forget . He kept reffering to himself in the third person. "Jimmy's under the boards. Jimmy's in the open. Jimmy makes the shot."
...I got you an apartment in this building.
I am not gonna taste your peach. I ate some one's pecan last night, I'm not gonna eat your peach.
Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.
Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?
We cold play Sorry! We cold play Steal the Old Mans Bundle. (Vanessa not amused; Jerry thinking) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (to Vanessa) What kind of perfume is that youre wearing?
Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.
Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent.
Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump across.
Get a march goin'! March it! (She exits)
Let's check out the glove box. (Opens the glove compartment, takes out a pencil.) Ah. Pencil.
(Takes the ticket back and looks at it, flips it over) The dry-cleaning numbers are gone too.
(through gritted teeth) Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage.
Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. That's a tough job. How would you like that?
No I can't she didn't leave her name or number.
So, Im on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the...
Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it.
I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?
(beginning to cough and struggle) Getting weak... Losing power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're nothing without me. Nothing!
Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight. In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it.
Kramer's Andre, he's fooling around with these 976 numbers (Kramer walks out of the bedroom) hey I told you, I don't want you doing that on my phone
Kramer, I've driven to east Hampton many times, I know the exit.
I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.
Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.
Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.
(seeing Elaine enter Monk's) Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with my body?
That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what is this?
She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route; years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.
Oh of course. Todd Gack. You did you bet was in Star Wars? Sammy Davis Jr.
He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?
(buzzes her up) Eh. (to Kramer) You know and I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying "my wife." Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - "my wife" this, "my wife" that...it's an amazing way to begin a sentence.
Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend.
Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.
I'm gonna get that. (walks across the set towards the blue curtain)
"What are you doing that for, you got a job"
Yeah, hes nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer, holding a paper up to Jerry.) I know, I know. Its down again.
You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.
No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.
No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?
All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?
But there's no "t" in your name. What about G-bone?
Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first thing they ask is who's responsible for this?
(watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans?
Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.
Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone.
Yeah, let me just stop by the cash machine and I'll meet you over at the coffee shop.
Now he's a character. (Pause) So everybody I know is a character on the show.
Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?
(Again, joking) A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em.
I dont bother with him. Hes been calling me for seven years. Ive never called him once! Hes got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if hes paying attention.
I thought you were gonna watch a video.
I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
(Losing it, mad) Look, it's not my shirt.
In my pajamas? I better get my robe.
We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us.
Yeah, so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. I've shown I can go all the way.
Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket.
Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?
Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.
It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that?
But the question is, are you still master of your domain?
You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.
So, um, do you date uh immature men?
There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of the worst all time toasts.
Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.
Well, senator, Id just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it.
All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy bar).
I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!
Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.
(Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right.
See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.
You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends....
It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors.
Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.
Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? Forget about it!
Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.
I-I-I don't like the opera. What are they singing for? Who sings? You got something to say, say it!
(Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm not sure about this.
Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie "Cinderfella". I got 'em at an auction.
Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you.
Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.
Yeah well King Edward didnt live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza.
No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.
Yes. Yes I am! (to Helen) What else did she say on the phone?
What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?
Well, it has nothing to do with you.
Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse.
(To cashier) I'd like to speak with the manager, please.
(Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?
But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?
This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.
Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.
Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.
What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do whatever it is you do. You disgust me.
Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?
Same as you cant overwet. You see, once something is wet, its wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die youre dead, right? Lets say you drop dead and I shoot you. Youre not gonna die again, youre already dead. You cant overdie, you cant overdry.
I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.
No, cab's comin' in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.
All right! Take it easy! Take it easy.
So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt?
I thought you said you were a good driver!
Oh! I got a message. (presses button on answer machine)
and I feel if we can just talk about this we can straighten the whole thing out, so listen, so call me back. Bye.
So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!" So he says to me, "What are ya gonna do about it?"
I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.
Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that guy, he just came in.
I have to go over to my grandmother's.
Sally, I can't believe you're already doing a One-woman show?
So, set it up. You know what, we could have dinner at the Friars Club.
Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.
In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be?
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.
And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.
Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours?
I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day?
Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen? Maybe he's setting me up!
(thinking) Well, the drive home should be a delight. Im speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I dont care. (to Vanessa) That's the manager? Do you want me to see if we can get another room?
No, I tried it on. It fits good.
Honey... Aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday?
What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.
You know what? It sounds like the friend of Elaine's that was hitting on me in the book store.
Yeah, you wanna get that meal, don't you?
Don't look at him. (Phil starts to knock on the door)
My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you dont make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee. And in that second ruined my life.
(to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you go the lunch with me?
Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!
All right. (opens door - Red light floods hallway - a buzzing sound emanates.)
Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?
All right, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be?
Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?
You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I give you 50 bucks.
He asked me if I was doing anything Friday night.
I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.
So what your genitals are still lined up.
Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?
So were going to make the Post Office pay for my new stereo?
Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a...
He's... trying to get something off his chest.
Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm alarge.
Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this. (The door buzzer sounds, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed.
Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!
(to the Drake) Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea. (To Elaine) Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat?
Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller. So you're Miss, uh...
How about when Harrison Ford jumped out of that plane, and he was shooting back at them as he was falling?
Ya sure, adoring's good for you, what does it do for me? (Meryl laughs. The owner of the coffee shop comes over.)
All right, so uh, let's do something later. How 'bout a movie?
Kind of in the middle of something here, George.
Why must you always be the focal point of attention? Why can't you just be? (Elaine laughs - hu) Why can't you live?
Hello. Oh! Hi George.......What! ..really! All right I'll call Elaine , we'll meet you down there.
(sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town.
Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not, a chicken.
I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?
Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?
Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania?
Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him to his party?
You know last time you had me throwin' a rye bread up three floors to you, now you want me to go up to the Bronx, take flyers off your car, where does it end?!?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term.
So, let me ask you something - these people eat soup three times a day?
Come on. I don't want to tag along with George and Susan. If you're there it'll be a better group.
I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.
"Don't you see what's happened, he couldn't talk , he's wearing these shoes, he's drooling."
We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.
No eight years isn't such a long streak.
Get in the car! Get in the car!
Oh...yeah...uh you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld.
(Pleading) Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.
You cant have that coat, it's not yours.
So why don't they talk like that now?
I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.
Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game? Were those your seats right behind the glass?
Theres the giant ball of oil. Clares right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!
He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck!
I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? (Kramer comes in) A real dermatologist.
Franco's no good? ...They got no team leaders.
I guess he failed to see the humor in it.
Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.
Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this?
(cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You havent been out of the building in ten years!
Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.
And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.
Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?
So he just shaves his head for no reason?
I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place, but that couldn't be.
No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!
It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday.
(to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here?
Listen, uh I just remembered... Im... uh, getting a facial.
No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.
Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?
Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend. (puts his arm around Elaine's shoulder, but she shrugs it off twice)
Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what?
An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. (Elevator doors open) Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you.. (Everyone but Jerry is now in the elevator. Jerry's still addressing them) Are we not human?! If we pick, do we not bleed?! (Elevator doors shut. A few people in the hallway are looking at him, he turns and addresses them) I am not an animal!
I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.
That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?
It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places, what do you bring your pocketbook?
Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!
Yeah have a couple of pieces, weak, weak gum yeah
Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.
Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down?
There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows.
I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bib overalls and pigtails, been counseled by Dick Gregory.
So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right here.
Well, I-I-I told my wife not to bring it.
Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.
(nudging George) Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.
Listen, Joel, I dont think we should see each other anymore.
So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.
I'm right here. (note he has an athletic bandage on his right hand) You're late.
(examining) Hey George, you know what? I think this crest is different. It's got a moose on it.
Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.
That was our babka. We had that babka!
Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?
But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people.
(to Kramer) Hey (snaps fingers) get your stuff, let's get going.
Oh, hi. I-I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I'm movin' in. I saw your name on the buzzer - You must be Kessler.
Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship?
All right, forget it, forget it. Im not taking the place!
You're not going to open with that, are you?
George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!
So I finally get to meet your pal Joey.
Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Giggio.
No move. So, you see, its all part of a divine plan.
Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The whole thingreal bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though.
No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter (pauses) Oh no!
oh I though you didn't care about his looks
Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!
(To Kramer) Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car. (Gestures to a black Saab)
Well I started screaming, "There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina." Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running (In the background -- CLERKS VOICE 57) and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.
All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good. (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura opens the door and gets out). What? What?
The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!
So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.
I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest - something's gotta give!
You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em.
Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.
I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a riot.
No, its okay now, that, that girl is not comin. Uh, I misread the whole thing.
I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.
Well, I felt bad about this afternoon, so I got you something.
I don't understand what the big deal is.
There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...
Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!
Oh, no, uh, go ahead. You got a pen?
(trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents.
Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from ourselves. That's what you said.
If only the coin hadnt hit the table.
Well I don't want to take too much off.
Oh, so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night? You wanna have dinner?
His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I wouldve been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. Hes so self-involved.
Well, at least have some reaction to it.
Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic.
On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!
I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ...
He's got the Kavorca. (looking towards the theater door, Jerry notices one of the movie goers) Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry-cleaner?
You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast!
(Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.
I said I couldnt believe you liked that commercial. So what?
No, no Isabella's, I don't want to go to Isabella's.
It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
You dont think it mightve had anything to do with that?
It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.
You're cut off, you're out of the loop!
Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.
I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.
I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.
Yeah I called before. I got his notice in the mail.
She's the model I met on the plane.
Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird... What are we gonna do?
Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking.
Non-fat yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even know it.
So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the audience really freaked me out.
(agreeing) well three years is a long time to be married.
She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend.
Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple.
Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign.
(pause, to Donna) You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name...
Well whaddaya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?
Ah, you know you have a hole in your sneaker there. What is that canvas?
Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese food, there's leftovers.
Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought.
Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?
(Sarcastic) Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to have them!
(still in tuxedo, tie undone) Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building.
What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda?
Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.
...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss hello thing anymore. (continues backing away) I'm sorry. I just can't do it. It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm sorry.
A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little decision.
This is the man you have a crush on?
Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?
Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?
you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?
I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation. The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, "You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?"
Wait a second! I never baited a hook with a rye before. Your hook is too small. This is for, like, a muffin. All right. Take it away.
Why dont you ask that doctor what it is?
-programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were here, I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'
Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should really be fun.
Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents.
Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.
What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in.
You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.
No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls.
It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.
So, I guess you dont find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming?
(having an idea) I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.
They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.
I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.
So George and I went up to NBC and we told them the idea for a series now we're just waiting to sign the contract.
Did you see that? What kind of a 'hello' was that?
Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?
I gotta talk to her. What do you think?
Really? I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women.
Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please leave.
Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?
(facing the lengthening line behind him) Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.
I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. "Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better in my life." Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, "I had a heart attack this big (Holds out hands, gesturing bigness) ..but, I gave myself one of these. Clear! (Puts imaginary electrode panels to his chest) Brrhht.. and it's gone!"
He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.
Actually, I was thinking of donating a large portion of it to charity.
Th..the jacket, it's not here. It's gotta be here somewhere.
Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?
See ya. (Jane Leaves; after the door closes Kramer jumps in shock) what's with you?
I cant believe this. So what are you saying? You didnt like my act, so thats it?
I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or somebody? What's with this guy? (Gino looks at him annoyed) Just asking.
So you want to go to the party on Friday night?
. . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?
Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would make fun of my name like you wouldn't believe-- "Jerry Jerry Dingleberry", and-hu "Seinsmelled"...
Wait a second, you got the Mark McEwan TV Guide.
It was the single worst moment of my life.
You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS!
Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings. Alright, it's time to go. Come on.. Up.
But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.
Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home.
(pointing to napkins; to Elaine) Could I get napkin over there?
Y'know I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle.
I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.
Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.
Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have any conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.
What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?
What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave them to me, how many time I gotta thank him?
Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you.
"Of course" was the last thing he said?
My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.
Well don't get too comfortable. As soon as Seth gets a real job you two are gong back in that chicken supernova.
Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.
Wait a second. Turbo? I didn't have a turbo.
She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.
And then there's Maude. (She sits down next to Jerry)
Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza.
Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'
Hey, I thought you went to the game.
Fasten your seat belts. we're goin' to see the baby.
So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?
Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..
We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What is it?
What if she's got no interest in you?
George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long.
(to the Drake) So it was a good party, huh? Oh... you're welcome, you're welcome... (to Elaine) They loved the TV, *loved* it!
All right, lets go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.
More cereal? that's your third bowl today, you had it for breakfast and lunch.
Meat? I dont, I dont know, go... hunt! (Kessler opens the refrigerator and sticks his head in.) Well what happened in the game anyway?
Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.
Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!
What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says " Aw, I'll just have some coffee." There's no truth to that.
Were taking Elaine to dinner. Shes got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?
They guy's in my house right now. What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone.
(Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the script?
You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.
Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game.
(tearing through his laundry bag) Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on, let's go.
Listen, Matthew, I-I want to explain something to you. Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do.
Well, I dont really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.
I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood.
It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.
Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me.
You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?
Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?
Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Yknow Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, shes probably screamin at those aliens, I gotta have a lo mein!
Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!
No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your trouble..
Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he could hear me.
I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.
Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.
(walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later.
Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?
Hey, what happened to your coat? And what is the smell? Is-ya, What are you drunk?
Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.
Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.
I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.
Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want? You're not a part of society.
Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!
Do you even know what this scene is about?
And that waist cincher, that was the topper!
(Whispering) There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.
You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't destroy someone else's.
I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.
Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that I'd do a set tonight, so, terribly sorry.
Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-
Oh why don't you go sleep over at Newman's.
Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself! (Kramer is speechless) I've been waiting for me to come along and now I 've swept myself off my feet.
You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing!
(to George) Hey, there's Pat. (calls) Hey, Pat.
Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever.
Ah, you're better off. Now you can just let it go.
Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so well and I told him he should make it into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? So, you uh, going with me to the auto show with me Saturday?
Mmm. Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie.
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?
What do you think the dry-cleaners is your own personal closet!
Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.
(Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!
Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You cant do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over.
(Nods) I follow. So what are you gonna do?
Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah.
No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her.
I gave you a taste. What do you want?
Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There are no ball men.
God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?
No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake!
You know, the basic idea of negotiation, as I understand it, is to get your price to go... up.
Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this uh considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check?
No, no. Its not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, its not like Marlenes a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, weve had like three lunches and a movie, and she never stops calling. (George nods.) And its these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if Im busy or anything. I just pick up the phone, and shes in the middle of a sentence!
...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple, not a half of a banana...
uh, well I can't help you there (weakly).
George, both parties don't have to consent to a break-up. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments.
You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100.
Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going on?
All right, let me ask you this when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot?
No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.
This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.
What do you care? You don't believe in hell.
Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little Italy.
Thanks, because I would really like... (distractedly puts coffee cup back on the table)
(picks up phone) Hello? (listens) Oh, hi Mr. Pitt.
Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater.
You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?
How about our little Elaine huh? Attended the finest finishing schools on the Eastern seaboard. Equestrian competitions. Debutante balls. Look at her now. Interviewing Mohels.
Who wouldn't like him? I like him. And I'm a guy.
We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.
Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.
(shakes his head) I'm very sorry. (closing the door on Phil. Jerry smiles and shrugs apologetically as Phil stares at them through the glass)
I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I cant stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion wont even exist. It wont. I think eventually well all be wearing the same thing. Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where theres people from the future or another planet, theyre all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided, This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and boots. Thats it. We should come up for an outfit for Earth. An Earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits. No speeches. They walk out, twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, That was nice. I could wear that.
Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.
What are you talkin about? Its fine, I love having you here.
(acting like he was walking on stage) Hey how ya doing? Good to be here.
Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer!
You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set-up a meet and greet.
So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?
Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?
That's a hell of an organization they're running up there. I can't understand why they haven't won a pennant in 15 years.
He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?
Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again)
Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.
(also grabbing) What're you doing, I got it.
I'll go if someone else drives. You going?
oh uh nothing, she just.. choked on a jujube
