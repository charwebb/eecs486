(continuing) No rejection, no guilt, no remorse.
So he just sidles up?
He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.
You're giving up that easy?
Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer?
Many times. You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything with the velvet.
Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.
Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.
What is that?
Oh yeah, how's that looking?
All right, but you have to go now.
No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing.
She's very assimilated.
(to himself) I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles. (answers phone) Hello.
. . . HE ended it?
Almost.
Cause I hit a whopper last week!
Ah, alright, four. Seinfeld.
He asked you to watch them not wear them.
Oh, where you going? The coffee shop?
Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back)
Yes.
Oh! Come on, you told them you're from out-of-town just so you could stay in a hotel room.
No, she looks completely normal.
I cant. Im on my way out. Theres no way I can do it.
Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Yknow Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, shes probably screamin at those aliens, I gotta have a lo mein!
Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.
(to Kramer) Hey.
You live on this floor?
But that guy has my jacket.
So, what's your first book?
How 'bout those Knicks?
Tell her what?
Really?
It was the single worst moment of my life.
Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.
Dont you think she woulda heard I was there?
Oh, yes you will.
Just chatting. Friendly.
Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it.
I don't know if they have land guys.
Hi, Beth!
What's the difference?
Well, I am sure I had a good reason.
Oh, sorry
Bazooka Joe.
That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.
Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean izz-it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. You know, cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell.
(suspicious) Well, then what're you doing?
OK, see you later.
Everything all right?
Sue Ellen Mishke?
What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.
Thats her! Shes here!
Is that right?
Tuberculosis
Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?
She does have a way.
Have I ever been less than forthright?
There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?
I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.
Then, what was all that sniffing?
Alright, take 'em.
C'mon, will ya?
Ah, he'd just deny it.
(urgent whisper) Elaine.
A marine biologist.
Is that Burt Reynolds?
Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es.
I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!
Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket?
(softly) Hmm.. they'll match my sneakers.
I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.
No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.
Eh, it went okay.
Pamela? Do I know her?
Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.
Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it, that's it. No airline goes, "Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land." (Imitates cannon operator) "I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago? (Cranks the cannon) Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a second.. (Cranks cannon to Dallas) Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you."
Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!
Not more of that crap from the Titanic?
None.
You werent?
No.
Would I have to get a gardener?
So what?
Hey, Assman!
(taking back the check) Oh yeah.
Where have you been? You know, you're on next.
By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work.
Why?
I need a can of balls.
One Tim Whatley!
Elaine...
(Disgusted) What is with that?!
Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.
You've had the apple pie?
Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?
What is this thing around your neck?
Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.
What are you talking about? I'm not goin' to do it.
...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.
Ok, Yeah all right.
(TO GEORGE) Hey George, you ever see one?
I can see that. What's it for?
The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.
What for?
(Thinking he's stopped Leo's thefts) Thank you.
Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come on.
Well we
So what good are you?
Well you know what this means, don't you?
Check the pile.
What?
Hey Richie
Why shouldn't I go here?
Oh yeah, right.
She knew that.
I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.
Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes.
I'm telling and you can't stop me!
Hmmmm...
She's your Lex Luthor!
Right.
Holy cow! Have a nice life.
Yeah.
Yeah. So do I.
Well, I didnt uh really mean a pony, per se...
The woman, she--
That is worse.
Give me that wave!
Sure. Why not? You're there.
Well, what do you think the big holdup is?
(to Kramer) Thanks for that four a.m. wakeup call last night. (frustrated) Where the hell is that jacket?
No, I actually find you quite charming. A bit verbose at times...
Don't spell.
Ya, see ya.
(bossy) What are you doing?
Aw, what are you doin' to me? (puts his head down on the counter.)
Bye bye
Relax. Who are they?
Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?
Schumann. (George stops himself, frightened. Jerry looks around the lobby.) Where are they?
Who's she?
I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.
Hello.
Thank you. (They continue walking)
What was on the list?
Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...
Woodhaven.
'Cause I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello?
I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. The woman is absolutely mesmerizing.
Positive.
Come on up. Okay, they're here.
Thats all there is to it.
Did you bump into anybody you knew?
What's the matter with you?
(Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your mail here?
Yeah.
No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one.
No, go ahead, I second-hand smoke two packs a day.
Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...
Come on up.
Oh. Your ballet tickets.
He's somebody.
Hand it over. Pay up.
what?
Outside! I saw him outside!
Ahh, Im a 40. Why?
I am not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to say t-the franks and beans for example.
Hey, there's a booth.
You didn't ... (makes motion like he's lighting a cigar)
Your butler?
Hey what are you doing Friday night?
Well...
I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.
I'm afraid we're out of time.
W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it.
(whispers) Damn.
So, I finally met the mentor.
(derisively at Kramer) Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?
Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight. Let's live a little. .
No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.
You really used to have a think full head of hair.
Anywhere in the city?
Actually, that's--
Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.
So...?
Oh.
Just in time for Amy.
It is kind of silly.
Oh, I can take it.
Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.
No. (Lanette leaves.) Did you at least pick them up?
Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner
You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca?
I mean, ... if you want to.
Well.
Yeah, I'm free, why?
Hard to say.
All right?
Mmmmmmmm!
(starts pulling them apart) Alright break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now (Kramer yells)
I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.
People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal.
No, he's still stuck at the foundation.
House in the Hamptons?
We had quite a little chat.
Always helpful.
Youre a little paranormal
Dollars?
All right! I'll do it. The race is on.
What are you telling him for?
Hi Jack.
No! No pick!
See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an "I'm not sorry" wave.
Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return?
(naked, carrying a belt sander) I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here.
All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about it. Get the Ross's out of the apartment. That can't be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait a second. Wait a second! You know, Kramer's been driving that hansom cab.
...that's why men hunt and women nest.
What do you say?
Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.
I thought you just said she doesn't know??
Because you didnt have a job?
Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery.
I usually like mine with an angioplasty.
Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure.
He's not after me.
I don't know.
First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.
Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?
Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?
After one date you try and improvise on her machine?
Did I just see that?!
No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.
...all right!
What're you doing here?
I don't know, I'm trying to help you.
It smells like the beach.
I can't believe this. A 5-19?
I paid what it costs.
No, I dont eat dinner. Dinners for suckers.
How do you stop a kid from growing?
I know. Neighbors.
I think he knew.
The dog. You're getting the dog.
What move?
She could be an 'it'.
Aagh! You come back for your clothes
What?
When is this suppose to be?
Oh, you'll find out.
Great! (realizing) What?
No, that's midtown.
Well, then Im not going to the game either. Okay? Ill give him both tickets.
(leaving the room) I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too much.
Ohh, you got the jacket back.
Why?
Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.
Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.
Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.
Feel good.
Hey.
(to the phone) Well, where is the guy?!... Nothing?! Almost half my moneys gone... Well, call me right back. (Jerry hangs up.) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasnt been home or in his office in the past three days!
The ticket is worthless.
Oh, isn't that what it's all about?
No.
No, it's a nine-hundred S. (happy) It's a turbo, Elaine, a turbo!
So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.
"Of course.... But that's got nothing to do with it."
Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.
Hes a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.
Oh
Yeah, I'll just pay for this.
What are you doing?
(Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow her) That's neat.
(Pointing) You're on.
Boy, you are really hungry.
(Looks around his apartment) Is it better than mine?
I didnt even know the woman.
Hey, so where's my sneakers?
So?
Hey!
What happened to you?
No. I know what I want.
...But with punching and kicking.
Music?
Oh, no, the woods! The hole!
Hello. Anybody?
Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father.
(a la "Don Corleone") Never go against the family, Elaine.
What is this?
Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look I?m serious, I?m not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it.
Itll take two seconds.
(Nodding) Yes. Yes I am. (Kramer chuckles) Master of my domain. But I will tell you this I am going over to (Gestures to the nudist) her apartment, and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down!
You'll sense it.
I think if ones going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. Its common courtesy. I dont know. Thats just the way I was brought up.
They could at least try it.
Hey come on, you're getting it all over the floor!
Oh please, I love her.
Eh.
May I see you outside for a moment please?
Actually, I haven't heard from 'em yet.
(to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here?
This is quite a condo.
Yes.
More everything!
Owen March, I never heard of him.
Ahh, I uh, I don't like to talk about it.
(trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents.
It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him, he makes a "Tada!" gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say "I'll see ya.", and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute)
He called the right guy.
So what now?
Ooh, (to Elaine) case closed!
Hello?
Like that (snaps his fingers)
Please.
Just imagine how much more you'll accomplish.
Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line.
What do you mean you show up?
Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I, guess she passed out!
We could visit together!
Seven-eleven?
Tic-Tacs work?
It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.
(reluctant) Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around. I mean, I wanna be a man too.
All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I will give you double what you paid for it.
I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. "Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better in my life." Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, "I had a heart attack this big (Holds out hands, gesturing bigness) ..but, I gave myself one of these. Clear! (Puts imaginary electrode panels to his chest) Brrhht.. and it's gone!"
All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.
I didnt tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have a hot dog?
Ah, it's just money.
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank me. Goodbye. (Hangs up) Hey, I'm flyin' first class.
No, Mr. Field, look, really I'm--
I dont care about it.
Does it ever bother you that this organization-
Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that?
Maybe.
"Transfer"?
(While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!
All right we'll wait for you.
Nah, forget it.
I mean, every time I see him, it's Tony this, Tony that. George is like a school girl around him
Eventually a little shot of penicillin
So he's Bizarro Jerry!
Great, I had fun. Wheres the TV, wheres the VCR?
Let's ask him.
Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors.
Too thin?
Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!
But not anymore.
Go ahead.
(quiet) Huh. Alright.
So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you this thing was good!
I don't know Kramer, ahh, my concern is that ....
To the Laundromat.
All right. (opens door - Red light floods hallway - a buzzing sound emanates.)
C'mon. (They exit.)
Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations.
Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night.
What's the difference? I agreed to wear it. It's - it's a puffy shirt. I feel ridiculous in it, and I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever seen, to be perfectly honest with you. (Nodding)
No, no of course not.
No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.
You know how they do that?
Right.
What are you doing?
YEAH? (speaking loudly so the visitor can hear him through the intercom)
You use a Water Pik?
Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The whole thingreal bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though.
By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.
Yeah.
You liked, Newman?
I wasn't thinking! I don't know.
(places two slices of bread against Kramer's face) That is close.
Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?
Cat fight with Raquel Welch.
(OC) Hey everybody! Who's ready to laugh?
You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.
Its partially you, yeah.
Two minutes.
(as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation.
Oh.. I know who's cooking today!
Its too far.
It's Sunday.
You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head.
Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display.
There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.
(Sarcastic) Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?
You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.
Well, guess I'll get going.
Do you like the Drake?
Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George.
What's the matter with you?
What?
Hey.
Dirt? That's alright, (for Jenna's benefit) because there's nothing wrong with dirt.
I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation. The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, "You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?"
I hear it's ah beautiful there.
(downcast) No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.
That smells good, what is that?
Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser.
No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.
Just keeps on getting better and better.
Hi Evelyn.
Youre engaged?
She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her. I mean it was "Beaches" for god's sake. What, what do you do in a situation like that?
George this is Mickey.
This could be an emergency!
(Reading the cover of the book George was forced to buy) 'French Impressionist Paintings'?
What?
Oh, you didnt...
OK.
You crying from "Home Alone"??
Maybe, maybe
They just wanted the armoire?
No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.
Kramer?
Which one do you think I want?
Excuse me?!
Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.
Like what?
(nods) Look, postcard from Elaine from Europe.
What's going on here?
Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies.
(on the phone) Hello? No, Im sorry Bania ... Im not going over this again. Well who told you to order soup? ... No! There's no dinner. There's not going to be any dinner. You've had a sandwich and 2 bowls of soup and that's it. Good-bye.
Hey! What is wrong with you?!
Yeah well King Edward didnt live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza.
No, no I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress didn't like the title and insisted that he change it to "War and Peace"!
All right. Calm down.
Oh who made you a Mohel? Whadya, get your degree from a matchbook?
What am I gonna say?
Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks out, shutting the door behind him)
Your name is a good name, Costanza. Sounds like it's stands for something, they'll believe us.
Why?
Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?
Oh, you're "Pappy".
Oh, it's comin'. - Here ya' go.
Theres the giant ball of oil. Clares right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!
You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you... (catches himself)
Do you think that's a bad sign?
You can't go wrong with pouty.
But why? Why McDowell?
(about the massage)You know I think this is really helping.
And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. (Waitress comes to table)
I'm nuts about her.
He couldn't believe it.
You see?
Newman! She went out with Newman!
I'm not getting illegal cable!
Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit)
You're not very bright, are you?
"You're turning in to Jimmy."
Not that there's anything wrong with that...
Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.
Yes, it can.
Ah, so, ah, flower shows and, shopping for pretty bows, and then back to her place, strip down to bra and panties for a tickle fight?
You're a hostage, captured by terrorists-
So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.
Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?
What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?
He took It, Out?
Never.
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?
Yeah.
Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it, Kramer.
He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine laugh)
I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.
Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of them.
What other time?
Maybe you should date the mothers.
That's a shame.
Ah, actually, I ka, kinda had some things to do.
Really?
I guess we'll never know.
Yes, I would take her out.
Breakfast?
Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.
Wow! What'd she say?
Hey, hey! I'm with someone.
After two dates!
Where have you been?!?
Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?
Oh yeah.
Oh! Hey!
You're returning used fruit?
(apologetically) Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe.
All right Nik. That's it.
In all of Tuscany? I wonder.
You know who speaks Korean?
Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show.
Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.
Really? (They start to make out, Jerry sees the pilot on the plane) Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!
We haven't spoken.
All right, just give me a western. (unhappy)
Who would pay that much?
Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office doing this? (moves his arm) He's gonna think you're a mental patient.
Hello, *Newman*...
Like fire in a school is such a big deal. (Kramer enters)
I don't have a paper though.
Listen to this "I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."
He's the Got-no-Green Lantern.
Uh, Huh, yeah.
Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something?
I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.
Oh, you think I'm lying about this?
No what?
Why can't I be normal?
And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
George, what's the matter with you?
Nah, I don't think so.
Hmm. Not bad.
We'll get a ride.
Okay!
(Thinking) What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship. Gotta relax.
Dad, it's got lots of other functions.
It's here!
That's true.
That's Step Ten?
(Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) He'll probably kill his family over this.
Male roommate, huh?
(explanation) He's new around here.
Oh, thanks.
Come again?
You can't prove anything.
You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.
You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of 'em.
You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.
No, I asked him.
Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?
Super bowl! Hey, an original G.I. Joe. (picks up both items) With a full frogman suit.
Hey, when Im driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. Im always waving everybody in. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. ...All right. All right. Ill have a chicken salad.
Alright, thanks again.
Hi.
Uhn-uh-uhn - Uhn-uh-uhn - - veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer A-Ha ha! Mission accomplished! Back to base, Joe. (singing) dee, de-de, de-de-de-de-de (Makes G.I. Joe swim off, legs kicking)
Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs. Whispers) The other guy.
What's the matter with you?
There should be more people like us.
A pinkish hue?
What do you expect? It's airline food.
Who goes to South America?
I didn't think so.
What're we gonna do?
Oh no, not you too?
She does not.
Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. (Faint) I don't care about that.
(to the intercom) Elaine?
Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this?
Yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee)
Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses.
Yeah.
(disgusted) Ohh! You know, and sometimes shell go, (imitates Marlene) Hello, Jerry? And Ill go, Oh, hi Marlene. And then its Jerry...
Well, I'm glad I brought it up.
What are you repeating everything I'm saying?
A Long Talker.
Yeah.
Come on up.
I will, I just walked in the door.
Me?
Shut up, you old bag!
Oh...
Hey, Happy Birthday.
Well, would you apologize for me? (Elaine nods. Poppie comes out of the kitchen.)
This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.
Entertainment Tonight's on.
(Over his shoulder) Not me.
Sally, you can't quit the business. This is all because of me.
Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second, (looking at the TV) Kramer, turn that up.
[his interest piqued] Minsk?
What, now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?
Got 'em on the street, from a scal... (catches himself again)
That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and-
Come on, lets go.
Oh, yeah. Right.
No, gore-tex. It's new. (Checks his pockets.) Hey, look at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look at that.
Hang on just let me pick up a paper.
What?
Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.
Loleola?
Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.
Alright Kramer, enough of this. Let's go find George.
What?
Yeah, well, until this bill is paid...
Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!
Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.
Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!
He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it.
What is this?
No. Thats out of the question.
No, I don't.
Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.
(into phone) Hello Joe, listen this is Jerry Seinfeld, I really think there?s been a huge colossal misunderstanding,
Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird... What are we gonna do?
Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the, uh...
Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me, they want me to come out and do the show on the 28th and they're giving me two free tickets to LA. You wanna go?
Let me just wipe the sink.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o! (haha)
(Rejecting) Ohh, no. No, no, no..
Yeah, that's right.
I'm sorry. I'm soured.
(Not believeing it) Prior convictions? Leo?
Oh boy...
(acidly) Shes full. So, Big Daddy. Im just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told?
We come from the same place.
You're going out with the stationery store guy?
They say, "What's your show about?" I say, "Nothing."
That's the way it works.
She's my ex-girlfriend I think I have precedence
Oh.
I'm telling you, she's good looking.
Is getting married!
Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!
(stops walking) Jean-Paul! (George acts like he scored)
she's one of these people, always have to be different
Yeah? Would you do it?
All right, I'm worming.
Tropic of Capricorn?
Oh, I'm delighted.
Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?
Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
On the other hand...
What's going on?
Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?
You're sure?
I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!
(To Kramer) Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car. (Gestures to a black Saab)
is beating the bushes-
I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.
I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing!
Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.
I dont think so. You know they, theyre so fragile.
I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it.
I was listening!
(pulling Leo back in) Hang on a second. I got a little proposition for you.
Alright, Newman! This is it! (Shoves him against the wall.)
Ah, it's probably like Smith over there.
Sure.
Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.
She'll have a cup of coffee and a broiled chicken.
Oh Hi.
Thanks.
Hey, I forgot to tell you! I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff game tonight!
Yeah.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together.
I'm with you.
Thanks.
Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk!
Fine. Go.
I want the massage!
Who is it?
Yeah , I was doing new material.
You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didnt take it. (pointing to himself) This is an idiot.
What, did you lose your remote?
Uncle Leo!
You got the tap?
Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.
What are you, a medieval dungeon master?
Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this.
Oh, how can you be so sure?
Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...(hugs Meryl.) I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run!
Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office.
What did he say?
Aw, come on there now.
Okay.
If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. Hes always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess its because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.
Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...
He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today.
I cant believe it! This guy ripped me off!
Crazy Joe Divola
Wha--you have a low sperm count?
I forgot.
Really?
Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.
Ah, that's a shame.
What do you need a job, you got Audrey.
He might die.
I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing isn't it?
Adoring? What about handsome?
Uh, Winona, it's Jerry Seinfeld.
They're busting this guy.
you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?
I went out with you.
What's with you?
Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?
All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good. (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura opens the door and gets out). What? What?
(impassive) Ah, I'm a little turned off.
It's a little short.
That?
Like who?
He's looking on to fridgerator.
I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up.
I can't eat this.
Okay, okay.
If I like their race, how can that be racist?... Hellooo??... Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!... Yyy-yes, I am calling George... Oh, the lines are crossed! You're getting his calls. Well, what do you know?!
So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.
(subdued, almost somber) Hello. Welcome back.
Why are the crepes spraying?
Did he say anything?
Just clarifying.
I gotta go to the library. You want to go?
You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.
Hello, Poppie. This is Elaine.
Alright, we're coming down.
George, Stacey.
But I, I didn't, I--
(zipping up his bag) Sometimes you do.
So you hurt Vincent's feelings?
We'll take 'em!
I'm right here.
I'm not in the mood.
What? Why didn't you wake me up?
Well, I cant wear it.
George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'
Where are you going?
Where did you meet this guy?
Ah, hi Jean-Paul. Nice to meet you.
You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are.
What is going on?
I'm open. There's just nothing in there.
Just talking? Well what's the show about?
Middle drawer.
You can't put a paper towel on his head.
You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to shower in the dressing room.
(placatory) Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me.
Try and stay calm.
Never happened.
No thanks.
Yeah! it's all taken care of.
Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
He does look like a horse.
I wouldn't use her toothbrush.
Give it to me!
Me too.
You're cold?
Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerrys office. (Elaine is looking confused). Were going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking confused) What do you mean hes already left?
I heard those doves were really incredible.
I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man.
So the squirrel's gonna make it?
Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin?
I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy.
I don't have to be funny, I don't care.
In two days.
Oh, I cant begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.
That's true.
I don't want any!
I'm goin' home.
Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, Im in a bit of an awkward position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants.
What's that?
They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?
I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.
You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts.
Yeah, right.
And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.
TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.
Well, thats it. You two are back together.
(from the back of the club, leaving) That's it I'm calling in the big guns.
They really stick to that understudy rule.
"The Switch."
(Like a father) Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.
Buyer beware.
Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?
Dead man walking.
Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.
Na, uh, no, uh, I'll hitch hike.
I'm buying you a new sofa.
Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.
Huh?
Yeah. Why?
Kind of in the middle of something here, George.
Oh, yeah, you mentioned her.
Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country.
I don't know what's happening to me.
Keep your shirt on. I got it.
(calm) I ordered in. It's still effort.
Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.
Fancy meeting you here!
I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens answer the door...)
Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.
Can we just go?
Don't blow this.
So they just gave you this?
Oh wait. Ill go with you.
Oh, really?
Oh, okay, thanks.
75,000 lira.
She's not there. She's doin' her wash.
Cops eating Milanos. What crazy town is this?
"I don't know how you can eat that spicy chicken,"
Hey.
You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.
What?
Pinkish hue?
She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there.
Sort of a mooching inventory.
Yeah, well I don't trust this guy. I think he regifted, he degifted, and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.
Coming.
You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address... (he spots a mailman crouched emptying a box) Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here.
Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores.
It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.
I dont give out bites. I got another one. But Im saving it for later.
Well, what do you want to do this afternoon?
Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.
Faux pas.
How's your family history?
No. nothing.
He said wuss?
What are you all out of breath from?
You could take it? You want it?
Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.
What's that?
(Deeply sarcastic) No. You're never here.
Hey, doesn't Newman have a Bruline racquet?
Yeah,, me too.
I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.
What's this?
No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.
You've really gone mental.
Oh, come on.
(disbelief) Milos?
Oh, the hell with her. (Paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her on the street.)
Why is he scared.
Let's check out the glove box. (Opens the glove compartment, takes out a pencil.) Ah. Pencil.
Didn't go for it, huh?
Patti?
Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car.
(incredulous) I gave you a hundred dollars?!
Okay.
I don't know how long this is gonna last.
Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it.
Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?
(Stunned) No, keep it. (Elaine enters the apartment) Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.
(Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No, you're not.
For what?
I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. Shes going to move in.
It's unheard of ...
Medium crab bisque.
Oh, sure...Truman Capote.
Coach to India - The only way to go.
Yes, Lupe. I'm blaming Lupe.
Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch hour and just take it?
What?
Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.
Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly.
You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner.
(reluctant) Mr Mandelbaum, I...
(to George) Is that uh, other apartment still available?
Yeah, big missing goin' on (spreads arms wide)
They serve soup at 6 a.m.?
Walked right over to her table.
You dont care?
She had man-hands.
What'ya do with the one you took?
All the time.
We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?
(Trying to shut him up) Kramer.
Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (He closes the fridge.) And I cannot overstate this No soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear?
I don't know.
They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.
Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?
Well, here we are...
Hey, that's great.
Is that right?
You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice.
It's at the jeweler.
Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes.
(a lightbulb goes on in his head) Riverside Drive.
Hold on a second.
Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.
Whats the difference?! Thats the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed...
Maybe this isn't my coat.
In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be?
What, your sad little horsies, the house with the little curl of smoke, the sunflower with the smiley face. the transparent cube... (as she leaves)
Conjugal visit?
So what?
It means he's lying.
(into phone) Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit!
And you want to be my latex salesman.
All right, what are you gonna say to him?
Thats got nothin to do with it.
I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.
Yes they *eat* them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!
Yellow? I wanted black.
What is this?
Alright, I'm outta here, and when I get back, I don't want to see you here (points to kitchen), here (points to living room), or here (makes similar circle with his hands).
What the hell?
I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?
It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?
I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.
I'm not *saying* she's deaf, she's deaf.
(TO GEORGE, REWOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy?
Its a bet.
And she wants to break up with you..
You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.
Bon voyage, Lainey!
Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.
Oh its your cat!
(picking up the phone and dialing) It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.
You wanna know? Come on outside.
Well I...
What did she name the kid?
Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame.
I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" thing.
He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about "Jerry."
Talk to Beth?
What kind do you use?
Oh my god, he knows. (Jerry and Gino scrambling) Go. (yelling to the door) One second.
So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.
It's moronic.
I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it.
Hello.
Why are you looking at my face?
So, what ever happened with that?
Newman.
Yes, yes, you have.
If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen.
(in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.
(acting like he was walking on stage) Hey how ya doing? Good to be here.
All right, all right. Whats the big hubbub, bub?
Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.
Were just not suited to be friends.
You got toilet paper on your heel there.
From your mother.
All right, all right.
What the hell is all this?
Hey.
Good, fine.
Thanks , thanks
(yelling) Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.
I don't want it!!
Come on, try it! (Audrey shakes her head doing "no") A little taste! (still shaking) Come on. (still shaking)
Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made!
Yeah.
Gee, I just didnt expect it from the way youve been acting.
Did you follow the recipe?
What do you mean, oh boy?
(Goes up to it) This?
What happened?
(imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi... Can't they just send us a tape?
No, I hadn't noticed.
I'm locking the vault. What?
"Of course" was the last thing he said?
Aah!
(checking his watch) I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.
He was buying quite a load of chicken, almost for two people ...
Wow, this is incredible!
Sure.
I know nothing, but what did you actually do?
I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.
No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?
Elaine was... in a rush.
Well how are you going.....
Ah. I know the chef there.
Well you might as well look it over.
Imagine, spelling Mom with two Os.
You could get arrested.
(feeling face) Good shave today...
You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying "I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street."
``Rochelle Rochelle'', huh?
What?
(looking at Kramer's moustache) Uh, we're not doing that anymore.
(pointing) There's George!
"All right."
Yeah.
Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry, you'd think he had a sense of humor about it.
Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza?
No, I don't want to.
Where you going?
I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!
..so uh she's just sitting there and a uh Packyderm, you remember the derm. He says uh, I'm gonna go up to her. So we uh he uh picks up the two pieces of (wipes his brow) pizza and uh the uh and then they're steaming hot and they're burning his hands see so he... he's juggling em (does juggling motions) he's jugglin em, jus throwing them up in the air and just as he gets up to her down they go. (Swallows and takes a breath) Well we all just lost it. (Fulton not laughing, stone faced) It was really really funny.
No.
My god, are you okay?
Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that.
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.
You must be George's cousin.
Oh. That's not quite the same.
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.
Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.
Eh, what?
How you doing?
I don't want the coat.
Phil... hi. I-I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely... by the way, made a mess on my door.
(defensive) I didn't ruin your business.
(disoriented) How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?
She died.
Your spare set?
Look at the size of his bird!
Ouch.
You like him?
Shaft.
Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer!
here.
But I changed my mind..
Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.
Well, he was wrong.
Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.
A phony? He called me a phony?
Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find ya, that's why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead!
I'd rather not talk about it.
What are we gonna do?
Forget the bench.
You just said you wanted it!
Hello? Is this 555-8383?
Come on, I'll go with you.
Is that something you want to do?
Irked?
Everybody's moving to Seattle.
Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight. In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it.
Do the bums ever complain? "Soup again?"
Elaine?!
Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.
Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..
You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?
What? All right, fine.
Plane's ready.
Right above me.
Well, I'll think about it...
Bye
Alright, fine. You figure something out. I'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money. 'Cause if this works, the whole monetary system's obsolete, we're back to wampum. (standing) I'm going to the bathroom.
How did you get this in here?
You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.
Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?
Eleven dollars for what?
You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal.
Yes!
That damn Mohel - he circumcised my finger! The Mohel circumcised my finger!
Another babka?
I said pull over by the stop sign.
So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul.
Yeah, sure.
Aw, you know people.
It's not that bright orange one is it?
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper made a reservation for me.
I dont know.
(in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.
Why?
You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won!
Ooo, could be from that blonde
(Confused) What does that mean?
(Nervous laughter) Yeah.. like a pirate.. (Attempting to get on another subject) Anyway, ah, you know, we're hoping to, um, raise enough money.. with this.. uh..
(fetching a drink from the fridge) Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money.
Keith Hernandez just asked me to help him move.
Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie, is that you?
Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations.
Elaine, Elaine... (Buzzer) Yeah?
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
How about this I manage a circus..
For what?
Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!
Named Suze?
Fine.
Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.
Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.
Oh Moses smell the roses.
Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?
What are you gonna get?
No, you don't have to buy anything.
He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.
A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guys got a coma going like this  you dont want to mess with it.
Right in the head! (leans in and points at Testikov)
(looking over the list) Hmm ah. I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?
Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!
Ah, you're out of your mind.
Maybe it's not on this level.
Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.
How do you like that.
You also shouldn't use a donut.
Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you.
I can't believe this.
Oh... yeah. What? I'm sorry.
Why not?
Kramer.
So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology?
No, Nothing.
Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.
What ever happened to Darren?
What stone?
Because I know who has it.
I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.
What?!
What writer? It's a sitcom.
I have to go over to my grandmother's.
Yeah, he's a bad seed.
A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!
Excuse me.( gets up and opens the door)
Kramer won't sell.
There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.
I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.
She asked about you.
I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little acting scenes.
Yes.
Let me walk you to a cab.
Which one you wanna go to shmoopy?
I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.
I would like to know what my names doin in this creep's organizer to begin with.
Well, well, look at you. It?s a little skimpy there isn't it?
Well, when is that gonna be?
That's enough. (They leave. George comes around the corner.)
(smiling with pleasure) You know, that almost makes this all worthwhile.
(under his breath) This is unbelievable.
(to himself) Gotta be an easier way.
You didn't go?
Fifty dollars. I Don't Believe This!
It was a so-so sorry.
Women need to like the job of the guy theyre with. If they dont like the job, they dont like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have. Well, right now, Im the regional management supervisor. Im in development, research, consulting... Men on the other hand  if they are physically attracted to a woman  are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men dont really care. Menll just go, Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whaddaya got a big cleaver there? Youre just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why dont you shower up, and well get some burgers and catch a movie.
(Complaining) No! That's the wrong doll!
How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!
I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?
HUGE pop-in guy!
She likes talking during sex.
What for?
Ah, George turned it down.
Oh, will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesn't mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men!
How's it doing?
You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?
Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room?
I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.
He's writing copy?
Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.
You can see it. You gonna walk around like that?
No, they're old cards from my grandmother.
How come you're eating your peas one at a time?
The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image.
Oh no.
Dont worry about it, it wasnt working anyway.
This is Laura.
(defensive) He egged me on.
George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.
Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And Ill need that in the form of a question.
You're saying I'm responsible for the couch?
He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.
You know their timing couldn't be worse.
Hey!
(nudging George) Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.
Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was that?'
Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson.
(in a hurry) Yea you're leaving at three o'clock.
Well Hello..
So Whatley sayd to me, "Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic."
We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we wanna make it to the movie.
You're gonna fight?
All right, then. I'll see you later.
I was lying, give it to me!
Was there a red-headed guy there?
Well, wouldn't I have to be? You tell me there's a can opener in the drawer, I'm looking in the drawer, there's no can opener - what other conclusion could one reach? (The phone rings.)
(Correcting her) Edmund Fitzgerald.
No.
'90.
I dont know. Its got a pink lining.
In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?
(Reading it) "A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund." - What is that?
No, I told you I admire your hearing.
Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind.
Well what's the next move, what's gonna happen now?
Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?
What the hell he's supposed to be on medication I don't understand he told me he's getting medication what happened to his medication!?
I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am.
Wow. Kenny Rogers Roasters. Finally open. Hey, look at the size of that neon chicken on the roof.
Where?
She's Gooone.
Im takin it, Im takin the place. Im gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place. Im livin here...Im movin.
I'm sorry, Kramer. (he goes back to the kitchen)
What, are you nervous?
What's wrong with lunch?
Uh, you know, why dont you go first, you just had a long trip.
So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!
You weren't supposed to say that.
Really? (sits on couch)
[quizzically] Live together?
No I can't, maybe you're faking.
Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?
Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.
George NO!!
All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go out the fire escape.
Did you see that?
Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house  and then I saw it in your house.
You know, she won an academy award?
Yes I was.
Sally? (Getting upset) Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?
Do me a favor. Just stick around while he's here.
We're not leaving the car!
It's kinda private.
All I know he was sniffing.
Sure.
Yeah, we'll do it another time.
Hmm.
The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.
For what dinner?
Yeah, how about a mute?
Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?
Come on,
Horse manure?
My show from last night.
This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-
Who makes copies?
No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!
So Kramer, what are you going to do?
Uh huh.
Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.
Oh.
(Gets up, and displays his own hands) Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.
Where are you going?
Kramer, are you drinking that milk?
She's been in Mexico for six weeks.
Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.
Me either.
What happened?
All right.. Go ahead.
... as long as one of them is not him.
Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?
Oh, cmon! Its down again?!
Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.
Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me.
Go ahead. Seems like a reasonable question, is all I'm saying. I would've asked her.
Oh, I'd love to, are you sure?
Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog?
Here! I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.
Yeah.
Stop smelling your arm.
I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.
Goodnight. (They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.)
Why didn't you ever mention this?
What's wrong with yours?
Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid ,stupid...
I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite?
You're like eight years old.
I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know. But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go "Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!"
Well George is an idiot.
What's going on? You're the man of the hour, That's what's going on.
I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.
Manny...
Well, I . . . [sees George]
Yes I am.
No. I'm not really looking.
I am challenging.
No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking.
Hey. So, keys?
What for?
85 cents? That is Outrageous!
What are you doing here?
Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?
That's enough!
(bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.
Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona, how does that hurt me?
(To Elaine) He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.
Flying Sandos. Beautiful.
What's with you?
(to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)
Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this.. It'll crush him.
So?
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!
Darren?
It's funny.
H... G... F. Seat four. One, two, three... f-- Hello Newman.
Is the flounder here yet?
Fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go.
Hey, hey.
Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.
Hey, what size suit are you?
I don't know...But every one's got to clear out of the apartment for two days. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my parents. they'll never let me pay for a hotel and if they go to someplace on their own I'm sure it's gonna be some awful dump. Wait a second.. Have you checked in The Plaza yet?
My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. He was with Brant-Leland for a while.
What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?
Yeah.
I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back stage and having to think of something to say.
George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.
Am I finally getting a baby brother?
Who is this?
Well, I'm not telling you.
What? Don't say that!
(on phone) Come on Adrian give me another chance, I know I could cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act (pauses for response from Adrian) No new material (Elaine enters) He's never heard it. He'll love it, I just did it at the Concord last week, it killed. (waves hello to Elaine; pauses for response from Adrian) Thank you, thanks fo.. you will not regret this. Ok, Bye. (hangs up phone; to Elaine) Hey.
Yeah.
And I don't want you to hold mine!
Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N?
(waving his arm in dismissal) Eh.
I will.
(to Kramer) I thought you stopped talking??
So, what did you say?
Mary! Oh, Mary! Give us a kiss.
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second. ! Celebrate! How about some champagne?
Then what was it?
Not even once?
All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.
Sid left the keys in the car.
ca.
Is this a problem?
(picks up the phone on the coffee table) 555-3455. Well wait a second, don't you see that's 555-FILK.
So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner?
You might have.
Oh, I'm sure you do.
If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen.
The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate's into the manage too.
Oh Come on!!
George!
We do what we can.
Where are you going?
Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.
I agreed to wear this?!
Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs.
I mean, she called me. I havent called her. She started it.
You're gonna keep these here for eight months?!
He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.
(CONT'D) You want me to help you with that?
Anything's *possible*...
All right.
Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.
Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said "Too bad he's gay".
I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! (Stands up.) They look ridiculous!
(sarcastically) Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.
Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you . What could he do?
What?
Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.
No, Trini Lopez.
I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
Oh. (Adjusts accordingly)
That madman is trying to kill me.
How could I have done that?
So?
Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!
Okay, just hand that over, please.
Kramer, I want my car.
My mother's.
No.
Ideally.
Yknow what? This is not that bad an idea.
Kramer, you can't talk to Frank.
Five o'clock.
And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.
Anywhere.
Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.
My what?
Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, listen, I was expecting somebody else. I'm sorry, I can't talk now, I gotta keep the line clear, I'll call you later. Yes, I know I have call waiting but I don't trust it in an emergency. Good bye.
Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.
That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.
Those damn 'I love you' returns.
The old-fashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong? Well first of all there's a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license? There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time? When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up by the legs and go "how do you like crotch?" If I wanted to see everything I would have been a fly.
What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do whatever it is you do. You disgust me.
What's the difference?
Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed.
I can't.
Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...
Yes, yes, I do.
Well, how else could this have happened?
This is a, Bob Cobb.
But not here. (They leave.)
Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.
(finding Frankie, in his hole) Frankie... come on out of there.
Good. Whats the matter?
So, the free love buffet is over?
He's not that good.
All right.
He used to go there a lot on business.
George.
I believe we're not...
(walking away) Well, I didn't sleep with her.
Why don't you get a sandwich?
Look at this, my ankle's all bitten up.
His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I wouldve been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. Hes so self-involved.
Where?
But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity.
Hey, George!
Well, either you see him or you don't.
Filks nothing, but 555-FILM is Movie Phone.
He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.
Well, I got to talk her out of this.
I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?
Are my nostrils getting bigger?
(To Elaine) Uh, well, you know, a coffee grinder is nice. Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. Maybe you should go get some coffee.
Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.
A little.
What did I do?
Oh, poor Blossom. (He sits)
I did.
(excited) Oh, my little airplane lamp.
Why do you even need anybody?
Pulp couldn't make it across the table.
I know enough not to get on them.
No.
No. I never had a job.
Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. (mail). A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble.
Well, I have this neighbor...
The actress?
Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal [and, ala Carson] Wild, Wild, Stuff...
Oh, that's classy.
No.
So?
That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.
So, you think Clyde told him?
It's Kramer.
Right by her?
5-19? What's a 5-19?
I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?
What?
....Alright, alright, I saw her!
They were all like that!
I cant believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.
That's good stuff.
So you want to catch a movie later?
The bris?
I was kidding when I said that!
I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?
You want to get a bite?
I know, I know.
Come on, let's go Jean-Paul!
He looks like you and he's working from the inside?
I did something stupid.
OK.
(under breath) Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..
So, you're using Frank's relaxation method?
I would like to propose a toast....Wait a second.. George! George Costanza come in here.
Come on up.
So quit!
And who were you tryin to set up, anyway? The mechanic or the manager?
I thought they smelled pretty nice.
George, Marla.
So, Puddy, I decided Im gonna go with another 900 convertible.
Really?
What're you doing here?
Whos he?
Neither have I.
Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable.
The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.
I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I had to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.
Whats that one?
Well... theres a little bit of a problem.
Okay, so how does it go?
NOW!!!!.... (she leaves in a hurry)
Forget the sports jacket.
No I haven't.
Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that.
Nothing.
Get me some duty free Kahlua.
(Looking toward beach) Oh this is interesting.
There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing *just* a bra. I can't get that image out of my mind.
....I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave me out of your act all together.
Never happened.
How is it a write off?
Kramer, outta the car. Out, now!
I thought so.
What'd she do?
Hmm.
Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?
So you're pretending to be a tourist?
Obviously.
Well, where is she?
He's from a.. Yakima, right?
Yeah, I guess so.
She's also quite bold.
What do you think?
All right.
Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better.
Get out of here, it's nothing. (Jerry knows George is hypochondriac. See 'The Heart Attack')
(Getting up to answer the door) Alright, did you get that line?
If he's black.
Uh, bathroom.
Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?
Yeah, one sec.
Hmm. So you feel "women and children first," in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.
And I'm always impressed.
Who told you about Martin?
You look like a tourist.
Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't believe I got the Low Fat!
Hi
Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled.
I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb! **
Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?
I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation.
Yeah, sounds like fun.
is that so?
I will show you The Stooges.
There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone.
She's all right.
In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with.
No don't do this. You're not doing this. I will fight you. No you don't... No.
Oh, the guy from Jersey?
No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. Whats important is you two getting back together. Eh, then well talk about the car.
Ooh! Very convenient.
(To George) You're off bread. (To Elaine) So what happened is it over?
Where are you goin'? Help me look!
George! Can we focus on the car, here?
Maybe a Cadillac.
Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. (Tim the dentist enters Monk's)
(starting the Dust Buster) What smell?
Leo?
Ah come on.
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.
Babu!
Hey George, do you believe this guy?
As a mater of fact, he did.
Take the K-man. A little support..
I can't, I can't take it.
What else did you two do?
No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman.
Nodding off...
Well, what is with you?
Oh, come on!
Yeah. Hey, dad, you sure you don't need any more money?
(Pleading) George, would you help me, please?
Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage, sighing deeply. Instantly, a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise)
Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket.
(on phone) hello.
to basically give this money away-
Good question.
