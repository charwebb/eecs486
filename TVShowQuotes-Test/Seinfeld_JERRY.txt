Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 630 and gimme a call.
I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!
How do you make sure your gonna get to the third date?
I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.
You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.
See, never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.
I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's like ... well it's like something!
(eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor.
The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city.
(with a wild expression) Hey, Kramer! I dug Fredo up, now let's cut him open!
You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.
Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.
(shakes his head) I'm very sorry. (closing the door on Phil. Jerry smiles and shrugs apologetically as Phil stares at them through the glass)
Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.
You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing?
Why must you always be the focal point of attention? Why can't you just be? (Elaine laughs - hu) Why can't you live?
Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?
By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?
I gotta say, thats pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.
(looking at the TV) Look at the picture on this thing...
Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.
No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!
It's like when tenant dies in a rent controlled building - you gotta take immediate action.
So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily.
Yeah, when I went to pick her up there was this dude.
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!! No!!! Thank you. (Hangs up.) I don't believe this. They've added Bania to the network showcase and he's going on right after me.
You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here. Mike Wichter. He sold plastic straws. You know the ones? You could bend them.
I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. Shes going to move in.
Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.
I tell ya, I don't see it happening.
You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.
Here you go. (Poppie stands up and takes the money.) Anyway, I'm sorry again about the...(notices a large, wet stain on his couch)...the...the...
Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?
(Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold. (To George) Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. (Back into the phone) Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. (Yelling out for believability) I'll be off in a minute! (To Sandra) Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of ideas? (George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed into the television. He seems to not even notice Jerry) Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. (Pause) So we're on for later?
See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.
No I'm not. (to Michael) George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?
I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.
You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short?
I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?
Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the transition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses... I need an awkward pause.
Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.
I know it's a big problem.. she puts like four pieces in her mouth, it's ridiculous, I don't think we're gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that price?
(to George) She thinks it's someone named Raef.
Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.
So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?
You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.
Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight. In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it.
Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.
Right in front of me!. How do you know we're not together. Two guys, sittin' laughin' drinking Champagne Coolies.
You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca?
All right, the whole elevator business, let me just explain-
Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.
Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum.
So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?
Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today.
Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.
What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?
Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?
(long pause).......Sure. ( humms a song then stares at the toothbrush)
So, how'd your date work out with the mysterious Connie?
You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?
You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up!
Oh, Okay (turns to rest of table) Im sorry, I didnt know what to bring, nobody told me.
Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me.
So, she got you to join a book club?
You don't think she's just talking to me?
I think theres a mental hospital near here.
Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that guy, he just came in.
Oh boy, did he say anything about me?
I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.
Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.
This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.
Hmm. Look to the cookie Elaine... Look to the cookie.
Why can't you do this on your table?
I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care
So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, hes thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, theres nothing left?
They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?
Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser.
Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.
You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?
(to Elaine) Where's Kramer? Shouldn't he be here by now.
Ok, get them over here pronto. We're in towels here George.
He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?
Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.
He looks like you and he's working from the inside?
Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester. I'll never see him again.
(Sarcastic) Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.
Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the sirens song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?
I am not gay. I am, however, thin, single and neat. Sometimes when someone is thin, single and neat people assume they are gay because that is a stereotype. They normally don't think of gay people as fat, sloppy and married. Although I'm sure there are, I don't want to perpetuate the stereotype. I'm sure they are the minority though within the gay community. They're probably discriminated against because of that, people say to them "Y'know Joe, I enjoy being gay with you but I think think it's about time, y'know that you got in shape, tucked the shirt in and lost the wife". But if people are even going to assume that people that are neat are gay, maybe instead of doin' this, "Y'know I think Joe might be a little... [waves hand back and forth]", they should vacuum "Y'know I think Joe might be >vroom< [makes vacuuming motion]. Yeah, I got a feeling he's a little >vrooom<..."
As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protg of my own.
No, car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car.
It's stuck. (pained) Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the wood.
Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.
Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?
(to George) You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.
Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.
Pull yourself together. Your going in there soldier! That's an order!
I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.
(Pulls the note out of his pocket) That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so funny?! ..That's not funny.. There's nothing funny about that.
You know my parents are coming in and I got some clean up to do , so if you and Potsie are done scheming....
They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. Kramer doesn't want a record.
Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.
Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.
You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon.
Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way.
I think it has something to do with me.
So why don't you leave it at Newman's?
I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.
No, I kinda tried to test his hearing.
(Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery.
She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Shake is bad, but what if its the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?
If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?
All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I will give you double what you paid for it.
Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like.
That's enough. (They leave. George comes around the corner.)
What's he doing? Is he out of his mind? Do you see him? I don't even think I see him anymore. Where is he?
They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.
There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.
Thanks, because I would really like... (distractedly puts coffee cup back on the table)
For some time... (video of Elaine dancing on the street with Jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.
Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed.
I don't get this. How did this happen. I don't have a dog.
What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him? 'Cos I asked him about the Knicks?
But they not you arent handicapped, arent you ashamed?
Could you move your car back a little?
Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?
(getting up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.
Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?
Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.
So you have no control over the remote?
So, um, do you date uh immature men?
No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.
Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.
I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.
How's life on the red planet? (shuts door)
(disappointed) Answering machine. (jovially) Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls.
(Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could.
Well, Ill tell you what. Ill choose you for it. Straight choose, three takes it, no disputes...thats it, you gotta win three.
So go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.
Yeah, dont investigate, dont pay me back, it was an accident.
(Stops pulling on the pants) Alright, alright, That's no good. (Moves Kramer over to the couch) Let me try getting them from the bottom. (Goes for Kramer's Leg) Just gimme one leg.
In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.
Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night. (Rachel shocked)
Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again)
Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that.
No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.'
All right. I'll be right there., Conrad I gotta go.
I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.
Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp.
Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.
I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!
So tell us about the trip. How's Dr. Reston?
How did you lock your keys in the car?
Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?
Okay, question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start over here this time.
Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time.
We cold play Sorry! We cold play Steal the Old Mans Bundle. (Vanessa not amused; Jerry thinking) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (to Vanessa) What kind of perfume is that youre wearing?
I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.
(cutting in) I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman.
(scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.
(in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.
Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?
So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind.
It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?
You raise the feet, get blood to the head.
I don't think so. Why would I do that?
Thats what you want to see, yeah. . . . Yeah, you want to trade your hair for some phlegm.
Hey, hey, what are you doing, that?s my quarter.
Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.
This is Outrageous! (To Marcelino) Pack of Juicy Fruit.
Well yes I did that's true. A couple of a guys I knew in the coastguard told me about her.... and I sensed that she had the anger and intensity that I needed to make this film work.
(sound of gunfire) Pkew, pkew, pkew, pkew, Pkeeew!
I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.
Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.
I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?
How do you stop a kid from growing?
I don't know...But every one's got to clear out of the apartment for two days. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my parents. they'll never let me pay for a hotel and if they go to someplace on their own I'm sure it's gonna be some awful dump. Wait a second.. Have you checked in The Plaza yet?
If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like Lex Luthor.
I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. (To Elaine) I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure and not watch it.
(on the phone) ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel! (hangs up the phone very disappointed)
Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that?
But then I found out about the skin cancer.
(as Kristin is storming out) Well, but, you see, I saved something! See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok?
Oh right, the new job, how is it?
Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.
So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.
Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees!
How could I know she would start to laugh?
Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs here for two and a half years?!
Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this!
(Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in.
If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.
Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.
The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.
Yeah.. how about this I say "How's it goin'?"
No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.
Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?
People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.
You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried.
Would you let go of my arm?! I'm trying to drive, you're getting us both killed!
Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?
Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out.
Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father.
I dont think so. You know they, theyre so fragile.
Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.
Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...
No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman.
First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.
Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you.
All right, bye. (to Elaine) You see this? Any thought pops into their head they're calling me because it's a local call now.
Uh huh. When youre on a stakeout, do you find its better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?
We come up with all these stupid reasons to break up with these women.
Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen.
Alright, I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine.
She likes him I mean she really likes him.
Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?
No, no, no. I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky.
Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage.
Cause Im an idiot! You may think youre an idiot, but with all due respect, Im a much bigger idiot than you are.
Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options...
What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a man and George doesn't want to hear his girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do I
They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.
I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.
Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!
Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!
So I didn't like the crest all that much., but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me so to get out of the store I told I wanted to see what someone else thought.... And then he makes a face like he doesn't believe me.
Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.
What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like theyre trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?
Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.
But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates.
(holding up the '# DAD' shirt) We're even.
You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be going downtown?
Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on down. (To Elaine) What?
Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.
Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a job.
Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking.
The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.
The female orgasm is kinda like the bat cave, very few people know where it is and if you're lucky enough to see it you probably don't know how you got there and you can't find your way back after you left. There are two types of female orgasms, the real and the fake. And uh I'll tell you right now, as a man, we don't know. We do not know, because to a man sex is like a car accident and determining the female orgasm is like being asked 'What did you see after the car went out of control?'. 'Uh I heard a lot of screeching sounds, uh I remember I was facing the wrong way at one point. And in the end my body was thrown clear.'
Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.
Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah.
Ugh, the four worst words in the English language.
Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this.. It'll crush him.
Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid ,stupid...
oh I though you didn't care about his looks
I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.
And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.
All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, "It's been real," move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business.
Well, ah, I've been looking forward to it.
"I don't know how you can eat that spicy chicken,"
Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off.
Okay, Okay, I promise. (puts on the headphones again) Wow!!! Oh Man...Oh God.. Oh Brother....Whoooaaaa!! Whoaaaa (Elaine enters he takes them off rapidly)
Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.
Yeah! But it never works. You know we're supposed to be there by two o'clock. We should take a cab.
I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.
Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it?
So then as I was getting out of the car, ...
So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.
"I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite."
Not that I would think of doing such things.
No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture.
He bothers me. I dont even answer the phone anymore because of him. Hes turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.
Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.
No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls.
Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
Why would I leave? This is my apartment.
Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.
(putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back to Sopie's) Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship.
It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.
He could have said "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!
I got it! (snaps his fingers) We give the keys to Elaine.
I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.
I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.
You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.
Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations.
The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.
Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.
Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?
I went to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of the urinal. So(throws away belt) thats it!
Yeah, theyre so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.
I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.
You faked it? Why would you do that?
Oh, you are? I guaranty you, Lupe is going to tuck your covers in.
Not because youre dirty, not because youre clean  just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine...
Look, I gotta try and help the guy.
(Joking about the bra-less wonder) Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support.
Well what am I going to tell Alex?
You are. I can't get that thing in my car. (referring to George)
Let me get a clean pair. (Goes into his room. George strides over to the window.)
I like that. (He opens the closet. Elaine walks out with an angry look.) What do you think, George?
You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.
We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving.
You told Testikov, (Elaine nods) that Tolstoy wanted to name his book "War-- What Is IT Good For?"?
I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?
(Trying to get rid of her) Yes, I think it's a fine idea. Well, good night.
You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS!
(Kramer waddling out the door) Maybe you can soak in the tub.
You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.
Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.
Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.
Yes it is. I got it as a gift, it's a Label Baby Junior.
Hey, I called you last night, where were you?
I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy could write checks to himself right out of my account.
You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are.
Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral.
Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me.
I kinda like this opera crowd, I feel tough... Anybody else got a problem?
All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy bar).
A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?
Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.
No, no. Its not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, its not like Marlenes a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, weve had like three lunches and a movie, and she never stops calling. (George nods.) And its these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if Im busy or anything. I just pick up the phone, and shes in the middle of a sentence!
I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.
She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this thing.
If only the coin hadnt hit the table.
Yes I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's condition...
(still talking to George) I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.
So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?
Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.
Maybe I will , Lois. Maybe I will.
Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)
Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George that she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with him)
Who takes care of your boy during the day?
Ah, just, you know, I don't know. Stuff, I gotta do. (grabs coat and throws it over his shoulder)
He's been sleeping a lot. He's still groggy.
Did you look at look at this picture carefully?
Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.
Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.
Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When are you seeing him again?
Oh that's George. (presses the intercom button) Yeah?
Have you ever spent any time with these people...?
What are you gonna do about the roommate?
He used to go there a lot on business.
Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent, wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye. (Hangs up)
hey, uh.. (Kramer walks around a little) what'd you get there?
So you dont know whats wrong with him?
Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.
No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex.
Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.
I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea.
Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!
George what the hell are you doing over there? I told you to mind your own business now stay out of my affairs!
Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so well and I told him he should make it into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? So, you uh, going with me to the auto show with me Saturday?
You know, Gary (slams shut the door) I had a little chat with George the other day...
It's been known to happen....... telling you right now Elaine, this guy 's gonna dangle that dress in front of you like a dirt farmer dangles a carrot in front of a mule.
Oh, just keep your voice down. Everyone can hear you.
The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.
Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. Its the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door... (Jerry pushes the door shut.) ...MUST BE CLOSED!!
Your name is a good name, Costanza. Sounds like it's stands for something, they'll believe us.
What was I supposed to do? You knew I was on my first date with Elaine. You come barging in here asking me to contribute money for a volcano relief fund for krakatoa.
Im always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice. Never quite sure, Is this the best lane for me? For my life? Theyre always a little bit ahead of you, Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there? Yeah, come on over here, pal. Were zoomin over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it. The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen? Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday well be going, (Jerry pretends hes driving in reverse.) Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad. Im gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way.
I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!
Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies, they wrap him up in a towel, and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big sunglasses case.
Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf.
(leaving) You two keep an eye on each other?
uh uh because then it would be all grown up.
When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers.
It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.
Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the show.
No appointments at all? (motions to Elaine to move over)
Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.
Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?
I dont even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, Ive met them three times in my life.
It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.
No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it.
Suspected serial killer, he didn't actually do it.
(looking behind the counter) Hey, is that Babu? It is! (walking over) Hey, Babu!
Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.
Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies.
Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal.
Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? To me tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. "That'll be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh."
I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!
Is that like the end of the world or something?
You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs.
I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.
Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.
What do you think? It's like a poker game?
No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!
There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.
Come up - Ah, there he is, the man himself, George Louis Costanza. Here I am about to go to the electric chair and my oldest friend is dating the governor
Oh, I get it, this is about the button.
(Smiling, like a salesman) All right. Now, what do I have to do to put you two in a relationship today?
I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?
(Pulls a small bottle out of his pocket) Uh-huh. Hey, look what they had on the plane. Schnapps.
Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again? (listens) Oh really? Well you can't break up with me over the phone. C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me. (hurriedly) Why d'you wear the same dress all the time? Hello.
In my pajamas? I better get my robe.
I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.
No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1,900 dollars.
I'm tucking! Hello? Hello? They hung up on me. They don't know where Kramer is anyway.
Back and to the left Back and to the left
Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth Whitehead, did I?
Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...(hugs Meryl.) I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run!
Well we're sitting here together. Why wouldn't you think that.
Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.
(noticing Alec Berg walk in, whispers) Hey, Alec!
He was buying quite a load of chicken, almost for two people ...
Look, what do you want me to do?
Whenever I see the news and they're hauling in some kind of terrorist, psycho, maniac, mass murderer guy. You notice he's always covering up his face with the newspaper, with the jacket, with the hat. What is he worried about? I mean what is this man's reputation? That he has to worry about this kind of exposure damaging his good name? I mean, what is he up for a big job promotion down at the office or something? Afraid the boss is gonna catch this on TV and go "isn't that Johnson from sales? He's up in that clock tower picking people off one by one. I don't know if that's that kind of man we want heading up that new branch office. He should be in bill collection. I think he's got aptitude."
It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back.
So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.
Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit)
Hey,that might be a nice idea for George's wedding.
Okay. I'll get it. (Goes into the bedroom.)
(Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.
Who figures and immigrants gonna have a pony?
Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?
No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.
Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.
He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.
Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?
Will you get this horse outta here. He's killing me. I can't get any oxygen.
Since when are you treating me to medicine? What are you doing? You're stealing this, aren't you?
Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?
I don't know, I'm trying to help you.
I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?
Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs. Whispers) The other guy.
Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.
First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.
Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?
Of course he did ..The guy's working ya.
(pause) I don't know, they just tell you the night before.
No in a matter of fact it isn't.
(having an idea) I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.
Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.
What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.
Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?
Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his Visa's expired.
We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her the whole thing was an accident.
By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you book it for the millennium New Year?
Revenge date? That sound like you more than me.
Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries.
Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
You do of course try on, when you buy?
He went to get some steak sauce. Why?
You know last time you had me throwin' a rye bread up three floors to you, now you want me to go up to the Bronx, take flyers off your car, where does it end?!?
I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help.
I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.
So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it?
No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac.
There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?
Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You cant do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over.
you know I'd like to hear about this job of yours
(finishing) The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over.
(testing Joel) So, Im thinking about going to Iran this summer.
Y'know, I think I'll pass on the "Guys And Dolls"...
I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?
Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you.
(smiling with pleasure) You know, that almost makes this all worthwhile.
Uh, you don't have to take a picture.
No, I think I would have remembered Memma.
That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little off.
The uh toilet brush is under the sink.
You know, I don't know the exact pronunciation but I believe its Manage A Trois.
Well, its a new suede jacket. It might get ruined.
Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!
So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to see your sister...
I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.
Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.
I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.
I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV Guide.
Well at least you and I are okay again.
No, no no [Elaine enters, flossing teeth] Elaine what's the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the woman.
Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.
Kramer, I've driven to east Hampton many times, I know the exit.
You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut.
I don't know, but you better keep it up.
All right, I think we've covered my act. Now you get out there and stink it up with everybody else.
Alright, sit down, sit down. (Grabs a pill from the bottle, and starts advancing tward Kramer - like an owner with his dog)
I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.
I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House.
(continuing unphased) You wanna get the other end, cause I wanna get it in the hall.
Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office
Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god. Wel-- how did this happen? What can I do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye. (Hangs up) That was Roy. He's under investigation for insurance fraud.
Well, you want to sit with George? I think he's coming with Robin.
(To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?
That's what I do with him [points at George]
Nah. It's not good for friends to talk about money, it can affect the friendship.
I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the "It's me" on the phone today.
They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same.
Anyway, I don't need your help. (Turns to leave.)
Uh, I don't know, we used to go out.
Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.
(While digging in his pocket for some money, he looks over the shirts one last time) You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt..
I cant. Im on my way out. Theres no way I can do it.
He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it.
I'd be very interested in something like that.
I know, you would drape yourself in velvet.
No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!
Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?
Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!
Well thank you very much, it's about time.
The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.
Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, THAT'S MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK GOOD.
(walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later.
I sure do miss my apartment. Maybe I'll switch back.
I love these nature shows, Ill watch and kind of nature show, and its amazing how you can always relate, to whatever theyre talking about. You know like youre watching the African Dung Beetle and youre going Boy, his life is a lot like mine. And you always root for whichever animal is the star of the show that week -- like if its the antelope, and theres a lion chasing the antelope you go, Run antelope Run! Use your Speed, Get away! But the next week its the lion, and then you go Get the antelope, eat him, bite his head! -- Trap him, dont let him use his speed!
(holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the fridge?
Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm gonna bring it someplace else.
I just thought ahh maybe I could talk to Roy, if um
I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep.
Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
(sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town.
Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent.
(Pleading) Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.
What? (Kramer hands Jerry an envelope) My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you find it?
Well, her belly button is like a mouth. (doing the voice) Im bored. Talk to me.
You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats? Cool.
(outraged) He's a doctor!.I mean it's supposed to be like a sterile environment."
Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the squeaking and the squealing and
Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.
'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.
Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...
Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone to ghost read it.
I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bib overalls and pigtails, been counseled by Dick Gregory.
You picked up on a vibe, from a nun.
Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.
You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.
(to Kramer) Hold on a second. (to Morty) Hiya dad.
Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.
What happened you didn't give her the papers?
So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER
Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. (Faint) I don't care about that.
Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.
Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. (pointing at the umbrellas) What've you got in a push-button mini.
Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night.
Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?
Hello Elaine? Patty Lawrence had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?
So Clare sure looked real funny covered in oil like that (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil
We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! Well be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life.
What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.
Well , as I said this type of thing is very common in show business
(playing Scrabble with his naked girlfriend) Zephyr? That is not a word.
Come on. Then you dont have to see him again til my 15,000-mile check.
(talking to George) It's working. (to the girl, who's tapping on the aquarium) Don't tap on the glass.
All right. Come on sit down. It's about to start.
Everyday is my birthday. (Sarcastically joking off what George said)
No, it's a nine-hundred S. (happy) It's a turbo, Elaine, a turbo!
I'm callin' Elaine. See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley.
What do you mean they're not going to do anything, they're the cops, they gotta do something, he just put the kibosh on me, do you know what the kibosh means, its a kibosh!
Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.
You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it.
All right, sir. (He tosses Elaine his keys. The apartment buzzer goes off; Jerry presses the first button; to the intercom) George?
Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with here.
So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?
(Defiantly) I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't even want the thing. What are you going to do?!
Don't feel right? What are you talking about?
I got you an apartment in the building.
Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?
Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.
Lemme just check my messages. (to himself) Maybe a nicer girl called.
Good, going good (scratches chin) And the higher up on the face you go the worse the relationship is getting. You know it is like - pretty good - not bad - I gotta get out. (scratches chin, nose then covers eyes with hands)
I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.
Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. (Joel shakes his head agreeing; Jerry smiles) You know, its their annual terrorist luncheon.
The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. Cause it says Waiting Room. Theres no chance of not waiting. Cause they call it the waiting room, theyre gonna use it. Theyve got it. Its all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and youve got your little magazine. You pretend youre reading it, but youre really looking at the other people. You know, youre thinking about about them. Things like, I wonder what hes got. As soon as she goes, Im getting her magazine. And then, they finally call you and its a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. Well, I guess Ive been chosen. Ill see you all later. You know, so you think youre going to see the doctor, but youre not, are you? No. Youre going into the next waiting room  the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You dont wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You dont want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, I have to see this! Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him? Are there seats? Can we get in? Do they scalp tickets to these things? I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two...
Ah, you're better off. Now you can just let it go.
Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot.
Hey Kenny. (with some fake enthusiasm, just to be polite)
Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding sir - lighten up. How about you, what are you in for?
Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...
All right, all right. Whats the big hubbub, bub?
Yeah, I know. There's no call for that kind of attitude.
Actually, I did. I put it on last night and slept in it.
Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?
(shrugs) Hey George I think I want to bring a date to the wedding
(throws out his hands) What does he listen to? The all Desperado station?
How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon, let's just go.
So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.
But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated.
Oh, you want to try the syrup! (Meryl smiles and takes it. The waitress comes over.)
Oh, OK. Next time lets play ping pong. It's easier to jump over the net.
The dating world is not a fun world...its a pressure world, its a world of tension, its a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I dont know what they need. I know I dont have it, I know that- You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one Im- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, were all human beings, what is the story? Ive never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, Ive never been in a situation, when I thought to myself I could use a cotton-ball right now. I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they dont need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, theyre like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? Theyre huge and two days later, theyre out, theyre gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin with them? The only time I ever see em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, theres two or three, that look like theyve been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I dont know what happened to them. I once went out with a girl whos left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over at my house. I dont know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. Lets move on. The dating world is a world of pressure. Lets face it a date is a job interview that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance youll end up naked at the end of it. You know? Well, Bill, the boss thinks youre the man for the position, why dont you strip down and meet some of the people youll be workin with?
All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?
(Looking at his notebook) Alright, I got, uh, you come in, you say "Hi", and I say "Hello".
Well, then Im not going to the game either. Okay? Ill give him both tickets.
But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment shes going right for that machine.
Uh, THANKS! This is FUN! Yeah, this turned out to be a GREAT weekend.
Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.
I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .
All right, that's not bad. Now get over here!
Okay, you tell me. What is it worth?
(Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's talking about) What?
Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin?
No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up, hes treatin me just like a regular customer, now!
I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo.
I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space.
Ah, high finance. Bulls, Bears, people from Conneticut.
And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.
Oh my god. This drawer is filled with Fruit Loops!
No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter (pauses) Oh no!
It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?
I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings)
Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.
I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket.
Elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man?
So ah, what did you do last night?
I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life.
Hey. So how was"Blame it on the Rain?"
(writing) Here's my address and number. And really, thanks again.
It's been three days and he hasn't called.
I don't know, this? (Shows his neck to Sara.)
Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you.
I don't have your suit. I gave it away.
Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made!
I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!
You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.
Whats the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!
You want to spend the rest of your life with her
Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?
Alright, I'm gonna get this. This looks good.
Hey, do you know what the Whip does?
But you yada yada'd over the best part.
I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.
Got lost? We went to school here for three years.
I'm just glad it's outta here. (Elaine exhales deeply - getting over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) What's that? (Pointing to a rolled up poster Elaine is carrying)
Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.
So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him mouth-to-mouth.
No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear.
How about our little Elaine huh? Attended the finest finishing schools on the Eastern seaboard. Equestrian competitions. Debutante balls. Look at her now. Interviewing Mohels.
Well if he's going then I'm not going.
So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands!
No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?
How much was it to clean the vest?
You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.
You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go 'Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If that's what you have to do.'
Ohhh... You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna.
All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier. (Elaine drinks straight out of the orange juice container) Hey.
Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves, wanted to come home and start working on his floor.
You know I don't even know why I brought you.
Hey ya know I read an unbelievable thing about Tolstoy the other day, did you know the original title for "War and Peace" was "War--What Is It Good For?"!
It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom)
I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.
Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right baby-doll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.
Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.
What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting index fingers? This is a sickening display. (takes the peanut butter jar away from George)
It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman.
Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--
Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, "Why knock my brains out?"
Yeah, Im sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.
All right lets go. We'll meet you back down here in ten minutes, hopefully with the money.
everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) Yeah?
Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that yogurt.
Im Jerry, Elaines friend, and this is George.
