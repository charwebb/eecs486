Evry-Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. "Oh, is he good?" "Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best." They can't all be the best. There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, "You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him. No, he's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher." And then there's always that, "Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me." Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, "Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. And everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs."
I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.
(To George) Hey, any luck? Did you catch 'em?
Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot.
So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.
I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care
Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford. I'm calling Beth tonight, and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you do likewise.
Well, you know, we were having dinner the other night, and she's got this strangest habit. She eats her peas one at a time. You've never seen anything like it. It takes her an hour to finish them. I mean, we've had dinner other times. I've seen her eat Corn Niblets. But she scooped them.
What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?
If they were fanatic about showers, they might.
I don't know. That's like asking "Where's Waldo?"
oh.. uh.. you know your breath is a little garlicky you better take some gum.
Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the best in the city.
Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen.
So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?
I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.
What the hell...? Why is the door open?
Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?
(Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.
A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.
(impatient) Gone! (starts maniacally laughing) (briefly stops to point and explain) That bumper sticker.
Did you say, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show" or, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show"? (Elaine comes over.)
Ive got the softball game on Wednesday. Its the championship.
You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be going downtown?
Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made!
Yeah, and, (Pointing to his watch) because of the.. (Slowly exiting) time.
Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?
Meat? I dont, I dont know, go... hunt! (Kessler opens the refrigerator and sticks his head in.) Well what happened in the game anyway?
Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.
Do you think this is such a good idea, with you being on the verge of this big promotion?
Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?
Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed.
"Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltezer after the salsa!"
No. I think it's Demi. (the "i" sounds like an "e")
Well, if I hear an anguished "oink", I'm outta here. I-I don't see any pig-men. Look (HE POINTS AT PASSERBY) Human, human, human... (HE LOOKS DOWN CORRIDOR, WITH ALARM.) (WITH MOCK ALARM) Wait a second! (Grabs Kramer)
O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!
(Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.
Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.
I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!
I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .
Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!
Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum.
I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch.
Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They sit) And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them.
Actually, we met in the gym locker room.
Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.
You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But its really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesnt it? "I really am a doctor you know. You think Im not, just check it out." I dont know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. "Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and Ill give you my opinion." After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what theyre talking about. In any difference of opinion, pants always beats no-pants.
Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? Im sorry. I didnt mean it. I took it out on you. Were still friends. Were still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look, Ill tell you what. Ive got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on.
uh, well I can't help you there (weakly).
I dont know. Theyve been in there since, like, World War II. The rents three hundred a month.
I'm gonna go let Elaine in. (Kramer reaches out to stop him leaving)
The way I feel when I go places with you? (Kramer enters.) Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?
(Knocking on Kramer's door) Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer home? Oh, hey.
Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.
That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.
Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?
You dont have to say Wow. I know its Wow. (Kramer smiling) And theres that smile again. Well, what is that? (Intercom buzzes.) Its George.
Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George.
Okay... [To a bamboozled Elaine] It's a business thing...
OK ... (nodding his head up and down) This is it cha know
Could you excuse me one second? Im sorry.
Goodnight. (They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.)
If only the coin hadnt hit the table.
...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple, not a half of a banana...
Gasoline? Can't you get it after you drop me off?
(to the phone) Hello? (disappointed) Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry hits Kramer with a magazine.) No. Uh, I was out of town. I just got back. Kramer doesnt know anything. Hes just my next-door neighbor. Uh, nothing much... Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. Im meeting somebody... Uh, Wednesday? Wednesdays okay... All right. Uh, Im a little busy right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning?... Okay... Yeah... Right... Thanks... Bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him? I hate just being handed a phone.
Gee, I just didnt expect it from the way youve been acting.
So he's been lying to me for two months?!
Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, (has his one hand up and his other hand down) he was down. Now he's up, (switches the positioning of his hands) you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?
So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg.
Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.
Nothing. I'm sure "Jon" probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! (Laughs uproariously.)
Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.
(animated) They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!
I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?
He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and his father was trying to load one of them
Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your outfit.
I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I dont know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because its really not a definite thing yet. (crowd cheers him on to tell them) Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that Ive received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. (audience applauds) Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. That's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didnt even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, thats what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, You may have already won. Id like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, You have definitely lost! You turn it over, giant printing, Not even close! You open it up, theres this whole letter of explanation, Even we cannot believe how badly you have done in this contest.
Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?
What, he doesn't like my taste in music?
I dunno, watch it on TV I guess. Why?
You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! (Snaps) They're cloning sheep now.
Hi. Hi Winona. Nice to see you again.
Oh, I see. So you can go, "Hey, you know who I saw wilding today? Herb!"
All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry.
Youre wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!! (pauses) You saw Puddy!
Honey... Aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday?
So, where do you want to eat tonight?
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!
I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench press the casket.
So you want me to get the books? Is that it?
...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Lemme tell you something if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. You're not going to be needing those for awhile, either.
A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?
Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.
All right. But then I can't tell you the BIG news.
Oh, what about 'ladies night'? Women admitted free before 10?
Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets.
This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!
Do you want to go with him? You go. I dont mind.
You were saying Stan? I-I'm sorry about that.
No, gore-tex. It's new. (Checks his pockets.) Hey, look at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look at that.
The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.
So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth? (Elaine laughs silently)
Hi. Sorry I'm late. There's a lotta chairs and balloons in my apartment. How 'bout I make it up to you with dinner?
It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.
See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.
Ramon, what are you doing here? You could get in trouble.
She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. [sarcastically] I guess we *fooled* her. I'll get rid of her, hold on... >click click< Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there? >click click< I'm back...
So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?
Oh, I get it, this is about the button.
Alright, I'll change my shoes. (Heads back to his apartment. George follows.)
Even if the dialogue did ring true. (Donna starts to get annoyed that Jerry won't let the conversation go) Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? Doesnt that bother you?
You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?
Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal [and, ala Carson] Wild, Wild, Stuff...
Yeah, tha's easy when you have no income.
I was an idiot for listening to you!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?
What are you bringing snowballs in here for?
I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this
So you go in the bathroom at eleven your in bed by what, two?
(weary) Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting turn out?
No don't do this. You're not doing this. I will fight you. No you don't... No.
I don't need a reason to give gifts, it's my nature. I love to make people happy.
Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.
I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.
Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There are no ball men.
Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!
Stupid cigars. You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldn't be together.
No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?
I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight.
No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant.
Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a back or without.
Id really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.
(To his parents) So? What do you think?
(to Kramer) Thanks for that four a.m. wakeup call last night. (frustrated) Where the hell is that jacket?
No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?
(to the man in the elevator) Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello!
(hits button) Come on up. (opens door a little)
Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.
Wow, look at you. So you got the job.
(continuing) The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.
How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car!
Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. Shes usually pretty punctual. Dont you find that, George?
You should always carry a pad and pen.
50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.
He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost got caught.
(To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot.
No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?
Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.
Ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves?
Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there's a chance they might somehow kiss.
Well, I don't think I want to date a protg whose mentor is a Costanza.
So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk.
So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? I'm gonna try to sell the van to a lot.
(watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans?
Its raining? Its raining. The game will be postponed. Well play tomorrow.
Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... What is this an ad for?
He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me anything.
Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it.
Back and to the left Back and to the left
Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation.
Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.
I don't understand. What don't you like about it?
Look Ramon, about the other day. Im sorry if I offended you. I get a little crabby on the subway.
Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.
Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?
Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night.
Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon...
So youre saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, its all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.
Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.
You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.
Yeah, so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. I've shown I can go all the way.
Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy.
Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a job.
That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.
Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in there?
Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.
I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?
There's no watch ... I threw it in the garbage can on the street. It didn't keep good time. My parents gave it to me, but I didn't like it. So don't mention it again, okay!
We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
(tugging at the clicker) I'm a great clicker! (gets the clicker back) Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.
Yeahhh, am I imagining this? (he whips out the movie stub and holds it up to Willie) Found this little cutie in the pocket. (throws the stub on the counter)
This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.
She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this thing.
Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. Its the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door... (Jerry pushes the door shut.) ...MUST BE CLOSED!!
(from the back of the club, leaving) That's it I'm calling in the big guns.
Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.
(Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.
(to Kessler) Yeah. (to the phone) Yeah, people do move. Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem.
(suspicious) I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.
Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.
It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.
How much did you wound up tipping her?
Hey. Hey, this is for you. (Taps the gift) It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.
What do you mean? They know we're here.
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and sit in it.
I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!
(going through couch cushions) Where the hell did I put this?
Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?
Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too. You know, we can't go anywhere near there.
Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers are all smudged out. (holds out the ticket and hands it to Bania)
Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.
Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.
Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo.
But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people.
I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?
Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person -
He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck!
Why should I have anything for say for myself?
Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.
Aah, top of the fridge. Hey George, I'm taking that waitress to the Tony's.
You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!
So you're saying, Store -- Hotsy-Totsy, Home-- Hotsy-Notsy.
'51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?
Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.
All right, do you want the quarter, take the quarter, but don't try and tell me it's yours.
Yeah, what about those English sirens, you know...eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
(to Jody) My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here.
I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.
Alright Kramer, enough of this. Let's go find George.
I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.
(Trying to get rid of her) Yes, I think it's a fine idea. Well, good night.
They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out!
Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.
No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know.
So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?
You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.
Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all.
Ah, just a couple of gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing.
Excuse me, uh...dentist? You a dentist? (The guy shakes his head. Jerry moves on to another guy.) Dentist? Are you a dentist?
Yeah, I know. There's no call for that kind of attitude.
(What's goin' on,) like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--
Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this.
Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.
Hang on a second. (handing Morty the phone) Dad it's Klompus.
"Jimmy's got a record. Jimmy's jumping for dollars. Jimmt and George are gonna get rich."
(to the phone) Oh, its you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldnt have had to do this. Now thats two long distance calls I made to you why cant you... (The guy hangs up on Jerry again; to nobody) Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much.
That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen -
My moms down in Florida. Shes got uh one of those condos. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?
When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.
I cant believe this. So what are you saying? You didnt like my act, so thats it?
All right. I'll call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from George] Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. well thank you very much. [hangs up] She has been in town. She's at CALVIN KLEIN's right now.
Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.
Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel?
ALL RIGHT, COME ON UP (Jerry puts his head down - he's not looking forward to Kenny Bania)
I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after 'thank you'?
Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything they want
"Wait a second ..Where you wearing those shoes in the cab?"
You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really... interesting. He would-
All right! Take it easy! Take it easy.
Yeah.. When he's dead he'll be relieved... Oh by the way Viking Press sent a Fedex for you to my parents. They brought it with 'em.
Well, what kind of a kiss? Was it a peck? Was it a kiss? Was it a long make out thing?
He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it.
(Joking about the bra-less wonder) Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support.
(Acts like he was cought red-handed) Elaine, what are you doing here? (Takes the pillow off George, and puts it back on his bed)
Theres nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.
(Getting up to answer the door) Alright, did you get that line?
Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?
Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.
It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.
Ah, you know you have a hole in your sneaker there. What is that canvas?
Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.
Ow. Stupid fold-out! Why'd they put the bar in the middle of the bed?
No, it's tarragon. Hey Kramer, I'm sorry about that whole fight we had about you having my apartment keys and everything.
Everyday is my birthday. (Sarcastically joking off what George said)
But that is not what they would have you believe.
So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here.
Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.
Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--
If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.
I was. But, shes got me, like, hypnotized.
Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?
Notice what? She's not really even a maid.
I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!
Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend.
You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.
Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.
I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo.
OK, fine. 'What do I have to do to put you in this van today?'
Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.
No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it!
(apologetic) Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.
They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.
Oh. No. What, you mean because of the "Chang"?
Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?
I'm not paying for anything until I get that back.
Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.
Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father.
Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways.
...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.
I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.
Well, You can't go in there it's like a gas chamber in there.
Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.
I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodations. And then, Knick tickets, floor seats.
This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.
Hey I don't even want the pen now!
You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught.
Oh my god, you're kidding. (dives for his wallet) Hang on a second. (reading from his registration) It's JVN 728.
Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?
Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off.
Well, maybe we should just forget about the cake?
Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas.
Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.
Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? (Still ignores him) Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Yea nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you (woman turns around and notices him) oh well, what are you deaf?
Carrot cake? Now w-why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry.
Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that.
Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt.
Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.
Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?
It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him, he makes a "Tada!" gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say "I'll see ya.", and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute)
What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of temperament?
Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.
Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?
(Still ticked off) That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.
(picks up newspaper, turns to George) You always take the shirt off?
I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment. (Slams the door on Newman's face. Then tries to delay talking to Newman by keeping the conversation with George going) So, you want a protein shake, or something?
Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?
Hey, get out of here...hey officer, he's fooling around back here.
Oh, great! Alright. (We hear the announcers calling the game.)
Hey, you know I'm on the phone with the police! Some guy just gave me a wise answer. Ask that woman.
What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!
(like a frustrated child) Why can't I know?
Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal....
There's nothing pleasant about it, so lets just cut the crap.. You gave me fleas. I know it and you know it..
Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door [Jerry pushes his door against Kramer's entrance]
Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.
Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian.
I dont think so. You know they, theyre so fragile.
What do you mean they're not going to do anything, they're the cops, they gotta do something, he just put the kibosh on me, do you know what the kibosh means, its a kibosh!
(wiping his brow) He could use a couple laughs.
Wh..why didn't you tell me before you sold it?
She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route; years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.
I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
Look, freedom with no clothes is a lot better than no freedom with clothes.
Yeah, see that's why I hate it. So, come on, you going to go?
Kramer this is Ramon, from the new health club I joined.
Krame? Sein. What are you doing? Well, I'm stuck out here on Long Island. What are your thoughts about taking a ride? You sure? Okay, but don't leave me hanging here. Okay, great. Let me give you directions.
Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.
Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. (They go out into the hallway and run into Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, Anna.) Hey, how ya doin.'
Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?
Well, well, why are you getting rid of your refrigerator? (he gets up from the table and carries a dish into the kitchen)
Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?
Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large intestine.
(Hands him some mail) There you go. Merry Chirstmas!
No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here!
So, dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices?
Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?
I'm not a foodie. I don't, "Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty." Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a hallway for some comic coming down at two o' clock in the morning? Why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little book. What is this? The story of the bill? "Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people.." What is this? A little gold tassle hanging down? Am I graduating from the restaurant? What is this about?
I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.
Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! (Kramer enters.)
Blow it off. Remember Poli Sci? How many of those did we go to?
I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.
You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats? Cool.
Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?
And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you thinking?
Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.
I can't believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends who this would've be their whole life.
What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce?
I didnt tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have a hot dog?
Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop.
I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?
I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust?
I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!
You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?
[quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's directed at *me*, isn't it?!
Do you know what this is all about? Do you know, why were here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about We should go out? This is what theyre talking about...this whole thing, were all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, were all out! There are people tryin to find us, they dont know where we are. (on an imaginary phone) Did you ring?, I cant find him. Where did he go? He didnt tell me where he was going. He must have gone out. You wanna go out you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...Then youre standing around, whatta you do? You go We gotta be getting back. Once youre out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, its my feeling, youve gotta go.
I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass!
We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.
One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity Strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favour. Do it in the tub.
Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area.
She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there.
I didnt know what the coma etiquette was.
(His thoughts) I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver.
Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies.
Fine, Mrs. Costanza. (Attempts to get Estelle to laugh) Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..
She thinks youre a guy that doesnt like coffee.
All right, that's not bad. Now get over here!
Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he could hear me.
Oh, that restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, thats a good idea.
What do you think the dry-cleaners is your own personal closet!
I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a "magical world" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.
Oh, what's the matter this doesn't interest you?
Yeah, well I don't trust this guy. I think he regifted, he degifted, and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.
(a lightbulb goes on in his head) Riverside Drive.
Let me in, it's me. (Kramer opens the door, Jerry goes in the dressing room) Here. You don't know what this is costing me. (hands Kramer the ticket)
Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it.
Uh huh. When youre on a stakeout, do you find its better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?
I'll tell you what happened. We got married.
I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?
Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?
Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.
All right Newman, one more peep outta you, you're out of the whole operation!
Sally, I can't believe you're already doing a One-woman show?
George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.
So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.
You cant have that coat, it's not yours.
You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?
That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam.
(holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the fridge?
Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. (Nervous under the pressure; Fulton not finding anything Jerry is saying funny) Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.
Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?
Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!
Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.
It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.
So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was just wondering if there were houses there to rent.
Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?
I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?
I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?
But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike.
Well, you know; not everything. I do what I can.
What are you talking about? It's my car. Let me pay for the gas.
... I just got a postcard from Elaine?
Oh, oh take it back. Let's get another one.
Good, as a matter of fact. I almost had my own show in Japan.
Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice.
Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that?
Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country.
Is that your "chicken" making all that noise?
I don't know, I'm trying to help you.
Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.
Who takes care of your boy during the day?
I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?
He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.
That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.
It's this one here in the back. (Tilts his head back, and knocks Elaine's trophy out the window. A loud hissing sound and commotion is heard from the street below. Everyone runs to the windows to look.)
You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To me the worst thing is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help?' 'No, just getting some air.'
Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.
Uh-huh, yeah. (Smiling, nodding, clearly wanting Bryant to shut up)
The dating world is not a fun world...its a pressure world, its a world of tension, its a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I dont know what they need. I know I dont have it, I know that- You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one Im- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, were all human beings, what is the story? Ive never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, Ive never been in a situation, when I thought to myself I could use a cotton-ball right now. I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they dont need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, theyre like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? Theyre huge and two days later, theyre out, theyre gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin with them? The only time I ever see em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, theres two or three, that look like theyve been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I dont know what happened to them. I once went out with a girl whos left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over at my house. I dont know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. Lets move on. The dating world is a world of pressure. Lets face it a date is a job interview that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance youll end up naked at the end of it. You know? Well, Bill, the boss thinks youre the man for the position, why dont you strip down and meet some of the people youll be workin with?
Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.
You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.
Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!
(Stops pulling on the pants) Alright, alright, That's no good. (Moves Kramer over to the couch) Let me try getting them from the bottom. (Goes for Kramer's Leg) Just gimme one leg.
You're not a little anything, Newman. So just pack it up and move it out of here.
Yeah, but this is different , this is like ,you know, semi digested food stuff. You know the next stop is the stomach and you can take it from there.
You were livin' in the village then, right?
He was buying quite a load of chicken, almost for two people ...
(watching George buttoning his shirt) What is this?
I had a statue! What should I do?
You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!
Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car.
Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?
(surprise) You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building too?
How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!
I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?
I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.
Well, theyre three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.
Well, well, look at you. It?s a little skimpy there isn't it?
Nah, I dont go for these non-refundable deals. I cant commit to a woman. Im not going to commit to an airline.
Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye.
Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?
You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried.
So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla.
Ill have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.
Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!
Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on. >click click click<...
George, both parties don't have to consent to a break-up. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments.
Hello, oh hi Duncan, 400 o'clock tomorrow? That is not going to work. . . . Why? I'll tell you why. Because I chose not to run!
Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.
So lemme get this straight you find yourself in the kitchen. You see an clair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, "What the hell, I'll just eat some trash."
I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?
No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1,900 dollars.
I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.
(To himself) Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not selzer, salsa. (George doesn't react) What's the matter?
Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.
Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?
Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you go the lunch with me?
(beginning to cough and struggle) Getting weak... Losing power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're nothing without me. Nothing!
Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?
Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.
I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place, but that couldn't be.
No, I had to tell my friends  my friends didnt have to tell you.
Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? Theres Elastic Man... Plastic Man...
(turns around noticing the Charter flight) Dad isn't that your charter group?
Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning.
Now, all we gotta do is write it.
How can you think of food at the time like this?
Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?
How much money is this gonna cost me?
Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. (Elaine raises her hands triumphantly, then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.) You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?
Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The whole thingreal bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though.
(Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.
Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?
Have you noticed people staring at your head?
I don't understand why we have to eat now.
So how come you're not going over there for dinner?
What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out.
So when somebody has B.O., the "O" usually stays with the "B". Once the "B" leaves, the "O" goes with it.
It's Kramer isn't it? I knew it!  The greasy door knob the constant licking of the fingers, he's hooked to the chicken isn't he?
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?
Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..
Hello is this Alicia? .This is Jerry Seinfeld.
(trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents.
So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?
You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.
Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!
(Surprised to see her, he gets up) Where's George?
Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?
Oh, you know these jewellers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries, wrapped in a riddle.
Howbout this, come one down to Leapin' Parry's if you can beat our prices, we'll give you the store.
The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in.
I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I dont get it, okay? I, I, I admit, I, Im not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, theyre so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, thats it! Its the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we dont know bout that, we dont know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas weve had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! I dont think she likes me. The amazing thing is, that we still get women, dont we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. Thats why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like Where to meet men? Were here, we are everywhere. Were honking our horns to serve you better.
Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.
I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...?
What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?
So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul.
Because you know we used to go out.
But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.
Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.
No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident!
Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.
Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup.
Newman . Open the door, Newman, I know you're in there.
Oh, hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet?
(To Kramer) Talk - call him from your house. (Elaine enters. Kramer leaves. To phone) He's calling you now.. okay. (Hangs up)
Come on up. (Jerry presses the second button and opens the apartment door. He walks back to the couch.) Oh, all right, forget it, Im gonna take it with me now... (He picks up the cushions.) Im just gonna pack up the cushions right now...
If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen.
Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. "I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... hahahahahaaa " Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ... (Naomi exits) it makes the juice ... it extracts the-the pulp and-and-and the vitamins, for-for long life and-and-and vitality.
Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse.
I'm gonna get that. (walks across the set towards the blue curtain)
No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?
Wait 'til I tell him about the book.
Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.
And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.
Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! (Kramer gestures sympathetically) And who buries a bird?
(proud to Peggy, under his breath) Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. (winks)
So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.
(Jokingly asking) So, did you have a nice week together?
So we could do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. Whats the matter?
Course you know there is always the possibility, that she called an audible.
Turn up the heat in your apartment! (opens a window)
So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?
Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the transition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses... I need an awkward pause.
Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital.
Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.
D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter?
I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on.
What do you think? They gave me a new car for thirty minutes of 'So, who's from out of town?'
Oh, big fighting marlin. (Jerry acts like he is catching a marlin)
Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
(thinking) So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?
Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!
(Sarcastically) Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.
I don't know. (takes off his sweater) This sweater really itches me. You want it?
I don't have it. You want half my omelet? (holds his omelet plate up to Bania)
No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.
Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way.
(putting on his coat to go downstairs, he finds the key in his coat pocket) I believe this belongs to you.
Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!
So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.
I don't have anything, I gave it to that guy.
All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.
Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.
Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!
(exasperation) You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car cleaned up for my parents.
Hey! Same initials . How do you like that?
I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.
Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.
(Pointing) But are you still master of your domain?
What should I do? (to Alton) Uh, were taking a cab, arent we?
So, what are you up for? How about Mexican?
Elaine its her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube back.
I'm not talking about upside down. (Jean-Paul and Kramer come in) I'm talking about waking him up!
I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?
Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.
Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.
It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.
Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'
I'm gonna call the cops. That?s what I?m doing, I?m calling the cops.
Yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania -- you give me the ticket, and uh, I will take you out for a nice dinner.
Well, the mans an individualist  he worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what hes doing.
No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I wouldve said tonight.
Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.
Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.
All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about it. Get the Ross's out of the apartment. That can't be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait a second. Wait a second! You know, Kramer's been driving that hansom cab.
There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone.
It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...
Oh! man did you see that. I ate discarded food.
I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea.
No, "yada yada" is good. She's very succinct.
Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.
Yes. (To Jenny) You're sure there's nothing we can do?
I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?
What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?
Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman.
Actually, I did. I put it on last night and slept in it.
Who do I know who would have even been in a limousine yesterday anyway. Uhh-O h-owow!
(arriving at apartment, sees Phil start to open his apartment door, only one door down from Kramer's) So you live right... there.
Yeah, I blamed it on you. Hi Tim.
Well I don't want to take too much off.
Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!
I'm laying down! Then we'll see how he does up there, without all the assistance.
Why dont you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps.) Whats wrong?
Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!
Don't you see what's goin' on here???... No boxers, no Jockeys...
Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister.
That's not going to be good for anybody.
I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.
(pointing toward the guy) See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.
Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind.
Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? To me tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. "That'll be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh."
I just thought ahh maybe I could talk to Roy, if um
(eating pop corn) hmm I love this artificial flavoring I like it better than butter I think it's more consistent
Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you.
That was brutal. I cant go back out there.
If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened.
Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.)
It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.
All I said was "I like the pen".
So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. Its a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and Im supposed to feel bad. Is that the way its supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldnt you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. Cause its not easy to give someone the toe, youve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and... (Jerry pretends to drive with one foot in the air, giving the toe.) Look at that toe, buddy. (He puts his foot down.) I mean, thats really insulting to get the toe, isnt it?
Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer of some sort?
Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it?
Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.
I... uh....promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her.
Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me, they want me to come out and do the show on the 28th and they're giving me two free tickets to LA. You wanna go?
(disappointed) Answering machine. (jovially) Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls.
Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.
You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley.
Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a no-tuck.
Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff?
Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.
(Fast) Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me!
You can't just *have* an adultery-- you *commit* adultery. And you can't even *commit* adultery unless you already *have* a commitment. So you have to make the commitment before you can even think about committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery. Then you can get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But y'know some people actually *cheat* on the people that they're cheating with. Which is like, y'know, being in a hold up and then turning to the robber next to you and goin' Alright, gimme everything you have, too''.
Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!
And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldya?
Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying it.
I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV Guide.
So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is--
Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..
Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house  and then I saw it in your house.
How about this? . . . Finish this thing up today!
wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, are you going to just sense it's in front of the couch?
Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately.
You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?
The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us?
I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.
(pointing out the obvious) George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out-Neiled him.
"...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!"
Oh, no, uh, go ahead. You got a pen?
