Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get it washed before I bring it down to him, or I'm afraid he'll yell at me.
Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen?
All right, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous. Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now.
Well I, I can't believe this. I know Phil, he, he's a good friend of mine. We play softball together. How could this be?
Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion.
No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?
I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep.
(To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?
It was just an innocent comment! I didnt know she had a pony!
Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.
(still not happy) Uh, alright. (he takes a piece)
(shrugs) Hey George I think I want to bring a date to the wedding
I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?
(opens the door for George) Where did you get that?
Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?
No, I do not like the bank. Ive heard the expression Laughing all the way to the bank. I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when theres nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, its empty and you still have to go through the little maze. (walking on the stage like he is going through a maze) Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? Im almost at the front. Id like a reward for this please.
I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?
I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.
You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!
Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.
"Naaaaaa...I can't watch a man sing a song."
How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car!
I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?
Ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves?
Ma, you cant look up words in the dictionary! (to Morty) Dad, shes cheating!
Im not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief? Put stockings on and roll em down below my knee?
Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out.
You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.
The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.)
W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?
Why? I've got my cleaning before without a ticket.
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
Forget that. He's a ball player. MVP< 1979. I'm making wise cracks in some night club. This guy was in game six. They're a perfect match. They like go together. They're like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike.
Its great! It speeds up the intimacy level. Its like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish (snaps his fingers) three days.
I mean, if were gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people.
Hang on just let me pick up a paper.
I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?
I think we might have one left in the stock room.
So, Puddy, I decided Im gonna go with another 900 convertible.
(Sarcastic) Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.
I'm gonna get that. (walks across the set towards the blue curtain)
(to the Drake) Sure! ... Okay... Don't worry, I'm taking MY car! ... okay... okay, see you later... bye...
Hey. So how was"Blame it on the Rain?"
Hey, were kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later?
No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex.
(answering the phone) Hello? Yeah, the van is still for sale. Sure, come on buy.
Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same thing. Perhaps it's an homage.
Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?
Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.
Suspected serial killer, he didn't actually do it.
Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? That's like half a pound of turkey!
All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting.
I dont get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?
What if hes in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? (Jerry knocks on imaginary glass.) How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson? (He makes a hissing sound.) By the way, whats happening with Sendrax?
Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't put up with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give me one hour, then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night.
I didnt know. Kramer told me about the worlds.
This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes) Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello?
I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When are you seeing him again?
(opening the door) Well, it was nice meeting you.
I dunno, watch it on TV I guess. Why?
No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.
A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the dish and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit.
It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.
Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.
See you later. (to Elaine) Well we cant all be dating podiatrists. (Elaine laughs)
So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up The good, the bad, or the ugly.
I don't mind at all. Why should I mind? What did he say?
Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.
Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving? There's no grace period.
Aah! .. right. The ones from Oregon that are only ripe for two weeks a year..
Oh, I see. So you can go, "Hey, you know who I saw wilding today? Herb!"
Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand.
You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?
No move. So, you see, its all part of a divine plan.
Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. (Jerry smiles. George laughs.) So, how's the book coming? (George's laughs taper off...) I say, how's the book comin'?
Hey. So, ah, Ramon this is my friend Elaine.
Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas.
Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who takes that literally?
I'll call back, thank you. (hangs up the phone) He went to South America!
Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into contact with --
But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.
You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink? When I'm on stage that's all I hear; You stink, You suck. We like magic.
Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?
I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.
And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.
(Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic?
Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?
You must have quite a time down there.
What did you do the rest of the day?
What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?
I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.
Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me.
(firmly matter-of-fact) Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.
Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks.
Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off.
(Rubbing it in) Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything?
I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.
Gina, do you know what a Drakes Coffee Cake is?
I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.
Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.
No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!
I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.
Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game? Were those your seats right behind the glass?
Who takes care of your boy during the day?
Hey you know we were just talking about you.
Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi? Uh huh, really, uh, no problem, definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough.
Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop.
(He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad.
Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.
Well, we gotta get it washed (pulls off a few flyers)....Ah, the keys are locked inside!
Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story.
Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.
Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.
(handing his dad a gift) Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday.
Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows.
Don't you see what's goin' on here???... No boxers, no Jockeys...
Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees!
All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.
Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?
I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?
Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.
Latex? And what do I do with latex?
Oh, Okay (turns to rest of table) Im sorry, I didnt know what to bring, nobody told me.
No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.
Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple.
Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.
Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.
Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.
So tonight are you going to make the move?
You got it ALL wrong. I was thinking only of the poor Krakatoans
Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.
Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!
(To Elaine) Uh, well, you know, a coffee grinder is nice. Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. Maybe you should go get some coffee.
With Jon Voight's teeth marks. (Looks at the owner's manual.) Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.
Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her.
Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!
Well, ah, I've been looking forward to it.
(Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.
Wow, look at you. So you got the job.
Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you have chosen to stay... is uh...
Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere... I got my bags, I'm ready to go.
You're going to make a good father someday.
Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.
Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.
Hi. Ah look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important that I talk with Julianna.
oh you're afraid he might look like Zippy the pinhead
Alright, I'm outta here, and when I get back, I don't want to see you here (points to kitchen), here (points to living room), or here (makes similar circle with his hands).
She might be. She's the star of the show.
The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?
I dont know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three oclock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someones door and tell them to keep it down? Youre really altering your whole self-image. I mean, what am I, Fred Mertz now? Whats happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. Theres a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. Shh... shh... shhh... shhh... Doesnt work, cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a shh. Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me. Some people you cant shush in a movie theater. Theres always that certain group of people, isnt it? Theyre talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They wont shush. Theyre the unshushables.
Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.
The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren?
Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't.
Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.
Nice Mohel picking, Elaine. You picked a helluva Mohel!
She was looking for someone to go to the show with.
You what? You passed? How could you do that?
(tearing through his laundry bag) Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on, let's go.
Who told you to get a massage from her. I haven't gotten a massage from her yet!
Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didnt like the looks of the defense and changed the play.
Ate? What? What the hell are you talking about? Now you listen to me, you get out of that apartment this instant. If you screw this up for me I swear....
I might need you to get me a soda.
The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.
Why didn't you eat it in the cab?
Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.
No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.
You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.
Im a guy  it always looks like that.
Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl. (pause) Did you?
I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.
He is merry, I'll give him that. (notices a cactus on the table) What's this plant for?
Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?
It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.
(to Kessler) Yeah. (to the phone) Yeah, people do move. Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem.
I thought we were going to the movies?
(annoyed) How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? Besides it's not a submarine and there's no room for a periscope in a car.
Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my shirt.
Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. (she starts the quick hand chops on his back) And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people.
You think they have fleas there, don't you?
Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. (George gives Elaine a look while Jerrys back is turned. Jerry turns around.) I saw that.
(hits button) Come on up. (opens door a little)
Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean izz-it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. You know, cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell.
Well how long you are going to keep this up?
Oh! Come om . He'll be over there for a half hour, he gets lost over there. C'mon so what is this about?
Ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from Florida.
--but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is inadvertently sent an insurance--
We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.
I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.
(to George) No. (to Kramer) I told you not to say anything.
Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a...
Yes. Yes I am! (to Helen) What else did she say on the phone?
Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated.
Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?
(explaining) I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the audience, you threw it away. Agrabah.
Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.
No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.
Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.
(Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn - grabbing a fistful) Listen, I - I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) There's been a terrible misunderstanding See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone, and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) "Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone." (Back to normal) You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. (To Elaine, whispering) Now she wants to have a drink with me. (Elaine mouths out "Just go" while making gestures. Jerry, again, gives in. Back on the phone) Yeah, I think I can.. Um.. yeah, I know where that is.. Ok.. uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. (Hangs up, peeved) Now I gotta have a drink with her.
oh! that's it I'm gonna put an end to this.
(thinking) Well, the drive home should be a delight. Im speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I dont care. (to Vanessa) That's the manager? Do you want me to see if we can get another room?
(out of window) George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!
They really should mention that in the breakdown height, weight, goiter.
A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!
All right, so uh, let's do something later. How 'bout a movie?
Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR wants you to drop dead.
Course you know there is always the possibility, that she called an audible.
Okay, okay. Forget it. Its okay. I didnt mean it.
Nah. It's not good for friends to talk about money, it can affect the friendship.
This stuff on top is my friends. Could I get it done in a separate machine?
Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?
All right, so I had wooden teeth, so what?
Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs.
Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes.
That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is.
But see look at the collar, it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash brings him one step closer, that's what makes the T-shirt such a tragic figure.
You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?
Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse.
Youre already moping! Would you take the place?
(examining the button) Boy, look how far back it goes. It's like a tooth.
Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.
There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.
(a little confused) You wanna hang out here, at phase two of the Pines of Mar Gables?
What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting index fingers? This is a sickening display. (takes the peanut butter jar away from George)
I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.
(to Rava) So, wheres this boyfriend of yours? I cant wait much longer. Ive got a flight.
You can't just *have* an adultery-- you *commit* adultery. And you can't even *commit* adultery unless you already *have* a commitment. So you have to make the commitment before you can even think about committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery. Then you can get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But y'know some people actually *cheat* on the people that they're cheating with. Which is like, y'know, being in a hold up and then turning to the robber next to you and goin' Alright, gimme everything you have, too''.
So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?
Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just "recede into the night," if you know what I mean.
So he's been lying to me for two months?!
What causes homophobia? What is it, that makes a heterosexual man, worry? I think it's because, men know, that deep down we have weak sales resistance. We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. Men think, "Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'"
You guys both have class at the same time?
You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack.
Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, (high pitched voice) Gone.
No, It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to New York a few years ago . she's trying to become an actress.
It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?
Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.
Blow it off. Remember Poli Sci? How many of those did we go to?
So we could do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. Whats the matter?
Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.
Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.
(quietly) I told you to cut it out.
What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast.
I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.
Damn, I was too overanxious, he must have noticed that.
Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here.
(Pauses, noting Elaine's quick accept) fault. (Starts to write a check out, then stops, looking at the door) Do you smell smoke?
Because you were too busy stealing a book.
I'm NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT! ..
Okay, Okay, I promise. (puts on the headphones again) Wow!!! Oh Man...Oh God.. Oh Brother....Whoooaaaa!! Whoaaaa (Elaine enters he takes them off rapidly)
(Still ticked off) That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.
You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone and see what they think.
Excuse me. (Gets up and answers the door.) Alright, what is it? You're interrupting!
Hear that? Guess who's back. (Opening the door) Hey!
all right lets be reasonable, Bania. Im taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think it's a pretty good deal.
But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people.
No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.
I, I'm not happy with what I wrote.
I dont know how Im going to tell him.
No, really, I just got off the phone with him.
(stands, puzzled, it's not sinking in) W-what do you mean?
Okay.. (Opens the door to a frantic Elaine)
Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!
Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the top of the order.
You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?
(nudging George) Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.
You dont think it mightve had anything to do with that?
Elaine, how about this shirt? Is this okay?
He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.
Ill call him. (Jerry picks up the cordless phone. He points to the rotary phone on the coffee table. Kramer, George, and Elaine struggle for it.) Hello, Ray?... Hi, Ray, this is Ravas friend, Elaines friend, Jerry... The King of Comedy, right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? (He covers the reciever and yells at Kramer and George.) Would you shut up?! (to the phone) Yeah, you dont want to talk about it over the phone?.. You dont want Rava to hear?... Yeah, I understand... You know that coffee shop near my house, Monks?... All right, tomorrow... One o clock... Great, okay, bye.
She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!
and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!
See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'.
I think I saw one a coupla doors down.
Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt?
Yeah. (subdued) I don't think this is the jacket.
Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you, which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.
I gave you a taste. What do you want?
What are we doing out here? Aren't we going to go in and eat?
(into phone) Hello Joe, listen this is Jerry Seinfeld, I really think there?s been a huge colossal misunderstanding,
(Getting up to answer the door) Alright, did you get that line?
(tugging at the clicker) I'm a great clicker! (gets the clicker back) Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.
He left me there. You see the mind games?
All right, I'll do it. (Goes on stage) Hey kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your home! (Audience boos)
No, wait a minute, wait a minute, that?s not fair, what about George, Susan and Elaine, what do you need me for?
You can't. That's why they lose very few players.
Come on! I know it's something you wanna do! (she pulls harder and he falls right off the table)
Look, what do you want me to do?
Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because moneys a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you dont care about money when youre hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, youre like the ruler of an empire. More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives. Then after the meal, you know, youve got the pants open, youve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. Theyre mystified by the check. What is this? How could this be? They start passing it around the table, Does this look right to you? Were not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food?
It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley.
Actually, I did. I put it on last night and slept in it.
Hey Kenny. (with some fake enthusiasm, just to be polite)
Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on, come with me.
Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?
What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police dont use them for, you know, crowd control. (Jerry crouches down, and makes like hes riding a pony.) Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey! Hey, little boy. Yeah, Im talking to you. Behind the barricades! So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldnt it? Just have a little pony and you put him on the... Baltic, thats two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right there. Baltic. Yeah, thats it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there.
You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow.
I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?
(Reading from his notebook) I got You enter, you go "Hi", and I go, "Hello." Now.. we need something here..
Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...
(sarcastically) Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.
Oh! but I do. There's probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar. ( as he says this Newman is wildly scratching behind his back. he suddenly stops when Jerry turns around)
He could have said "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.
Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.
Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.
I dunno how that guy gave us the slip at the Friars Club.
Yeah, killed. Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like that fish that attaches himself to the shark.
Well, George doesn't think $13,000 is enough money.
So have your parents found out about it?
Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.
(still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?
Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. who sacrifice so much for so long.
Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?
No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!
(interrupts)like a shark fisherman with a bucket of (?) Ch....
(touching the back of his neck) It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here.
So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?
Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt to my mother, my mother to my uncle...
Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.
I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.
well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.
Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something.
Wait a minute! (A manic chase scene ensues, with Jerry chasing Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.)
Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?
Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle?
So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor.
I was out in the snow last night.
Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return?
Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.
I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.
Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.
I was ready to get jiggy with it.
The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.
He was running from a bee. (Elaine laughs)
Well you know what this means, don't you?
So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. It's sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in.
What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a man and George doesn't want to hear his girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do I
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!
I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,...
Sally? (Getting upset) Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?
(To Elaine) He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.
Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room)
(disappointed) Answering machine. (jovially) Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls.
(shakes his head) I'm very sorry. (closing the door on Phil. Jerry smiles and shrugs apologetically as Phil stares at them through the glass)
Well, look at this guy. Look, hes got everything, hes got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners.  This is not his first load.
Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks.
You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?
All right. But then I can't tell you the BIG news.
What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.
I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society.
I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?
Well, for one think, don't listen to him.
It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. It got to me. And that orgasm stuff orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure!
You don't understand, someone's after us, a crazy clown is trying to kill us.
(unheard by Jenna) When the battery runs out.
Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal.
Fourteen years down the drain. (points and walks off -- to the bathroom)
So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.
Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess youre not going in anymore.
Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it - there's no two ways about it.
This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit?
Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.
Who, who, who do you think would win in a fight between me and ah, gorgeous George here. (pointing up and down at George)
Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!
You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances.
[rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end] Okay, I get your point!
Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction.
(to Kramer) Hold on a second. (to Morty) Hiya dad.
Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area.
You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD!
Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.
Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country.
You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.
Come up - Ah, there he is, the man himself, George Louis Costanza. Here I am about to go to the electric chair and my oldest friend is dating the governor
All right! I'll do it. The race is on.
Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.
More Pledge! I just bought two cans last week and I don't even have any wood in the house!
What's happening? What, you doing, come and talk to us.
I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--
Yeah, Im going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days.
That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood.
First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.
I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on.
(Interrupting Bania) Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it.
Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)
(trying to divert Vic's attention) What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that?
Here you go. (Poppie stands up and takes the money.) Anyway, I'm sorry again about the...(notices a large, wet stain on his couch)...the...the...
Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.
So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.
If only the coin hadnt hit the table.
I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call me back.
Doesn't matter, This is it. This completes the transaction.
Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll *all* be over...
Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!
I said, "How come no one's killed her?" Probably shouldn't have said anything,
I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?
You don't think I make money. That's what you think isn't it?
(examining the label) Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect.
(calls) Hey you two. Im ready to go.
Well I, if it's your day off I really... (tries to leave)
No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.
You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.
I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday.
Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.
Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.
Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?
Look at this. They make a point of saying on the menu, No egg white omelets. Look at that.
I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.
(still in tuxedo, tie undone) Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building.
So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you?
Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference who's tall. We're all tall.
We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her the whole thing was an accident.
You did not tell me not to sell.
Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.
Will you put that thing out before you start another fire. You had to give him a box of cigars.
No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too.
Oh, no. Its not that I dont think you can. I know that you cant, and Im positive that you wont.
What's even more amazing is his formal training is in pediatrics.
How could she not tell me where she was staying?
Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?
I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different... sources.
Well, either you see him or you don't.
No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get it done.
This is insane. You know, I dont even know where shes staying! She, shes not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.
Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me off.
This is no good. This is no good. Call her house.
You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.
Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going "Close the door, you're letting all the heat off the sun. I'm trying to get a sweat going."
Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you (throws the bottle to Kramer.)
We don't hear that. (They enter the elevator)
What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact, forget the money. I dont even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. Thats what I want. I want an admission of guilt.
Melanie, you can shush me at every opportunity. 5? 3? Oh, it was just an expression. All right, well, that's very sweet of you. Okay, I'll call you later. All right, bye. Hey!
Lemme just check my messages. (to himself) Maybe a nicer girl called.
Well, you want your organizer back don't you?
I think I offended the wake-up guy...! (worried)
(Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) It's very comical..
That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?
(Opens the door) C'mon, you wanna go for a ride? (Starts jiggling his keys - as if he's calling out for a dog) Huh? C'mon! C'mon!
(picks up phone) Hello? (listens) Oh, hi Mr. Pitt.
We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked.
See I was saying "six" but she thought I was saying "sex". We straightened the whole thing out though.
To a guy you've never met? (mild sarcasm) Your screening process is getting ever more rigorous.
(While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? (Hands him a nickel)
She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.
You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?
Hey what about Dr. Resnick My Uncle Leo is going to see him tomorrow .
You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's wedding.
(yelling) Yes I told him the Packyderm story!
Milos, I can assure you, I had no intention of telling anyone about your unbelievably bad tennis playing.
That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add.
Thats comforting. Shh. Hes coming. (to Ray) Ray?
Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie or something.
You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?
So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had *gained* strength throughout the night...
(proud of himself) Remember me? I said I 'd come back with someone and I did. Surprised?.
And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone.
Yes I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's condition...
(To Kramer) Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!
Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise.
Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why dont we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. (All three sit down) Now, look, you both find each other attractive, right?
Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that.
But I don't know if this is gonna work.
(To George, in a 'cha-ching!' motion) Vermont! (To Ellen) With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to! (George is disturbed. He gets up, goes go Kramer's door, and knocks. They talk) Four days at a beautiful bed-and-breakfast! I can't wait.. buy-bye. (Hangs up. George and Kramer come into Jerry's apartment, confronting him) What? (George takes the phone off the hook) What is this?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term.
Its not promised to anybody? Cause shed take it in a second.
You know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on Elaine right in front of me. He stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems to like. You know what I'm gonna do.? I'm gonna take that jacket back.. I'm putting this guy ....RIGHT OUT OF COMMISSION....
Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister.
Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.
No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.
I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.
Sure, Beth, these things happen. (Brief pause) So, have you told many.. people yet?
Sex... to save the friendship. (Elaine drops her bag, takes off her jacket and walks into Jerry's bedroom) Well, if we have to (un-tucks his shirt) we have to.
Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, Ill see ya.
Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes.
It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.
It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?
Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, "Hey, they like the soup! Keep it up!"?
Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?
Fifty years they were married. Now hes moving to Pheonix.
From my house. I got a whole box of them.
Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office
So, ah, what are you doing around here Ramon?
Uhm, hold, hold on a second. (pauses counting) I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.
But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?
Oh, I know her. I know her type.
Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign 'em.
And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.
Nope, the cop says its my word against his. Theres nothing they can do.
Happy camper , I don't hear that expression enough.
No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.
I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like it.
If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of a barber.
Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.
He's got the Kavorca. (looking towards the theater door, Jerry notices one of the movie goers) Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry-cleaner?
Wouldnt it be great if you could ask a woman what shes thinking?
(While digging in his pocket for some money, he looks over the shirts one last time) You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt..
Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable.
Oh no, where's the blood? (opens the fridge) It's in here isn't it?
Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.
Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?
I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
hello. Oh, hi. What's happening?  what? oh um, sure,  um, yeah, okay, uh. I'll see you then. Yeah, yeah, Bye.
Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie?
It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman.
Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that?
I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!
I didn,t tell you to park in that lot .. Now someone's gonna have to drive you every time you need your car.? Take the bus!
Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage, sighing deeply. Instantly, a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise)
That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and-
Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.
Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.
(jumps in surprise) Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be gone.
That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. Anyway what can I do, I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow. It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin.
Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.
(on the phone) hey Andre, get the hell off the phone!
(on the phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second. (George walks in  Jerry asks George) So we definitely dont want to do the voice anymore? (George shakes his head NO) Alright, were back together again, great. Bye bye.
Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.
Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home.
(standing in the bathtub) Now my sense of it is that you're probably wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another.
A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's none of my business.
There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.
Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?
You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But its really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesnt it? "I really am a doctor you know. You think Im not, just check it out." I dont know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. "Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and Ill give you my opinion." After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what theyre talking about. In any difference of opinion, pants always beats no-pants.
You got toilet paper on your heel there.
Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...
Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?
Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed like ten new minutes.
Elaine, have you noticed George was acting strange the whole flight?
Would you turn that down! What is that crap!
What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him, I dont think were right for each other. Hes a guy! At least with a woman, theres a precendent. You know, the relationship goes sour, you end it.
No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book in 1971. I have a witness Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum. It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it. (thinks out loud, opens phone book) Becker, ... Becker, ...
(holding up the '# DAD' shirt) We're even.
(Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.
We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)
George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.
Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.
Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?
Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.
Yeah Ive got this old bottle of cough medicine.
Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off.
Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down?
He feels funny. You don't have to do this.
Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!
So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital?
She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either.
Oh! He said that! Can you imagine what he'll do if he sees me with you! He'll think I?m the one who ruined his deal at NBC and took away his girl, he'll put a kibosh on me!
What about this? This is blood isn't it?!
Who wouldn't like him? I like him. And I'm a guy.
(To Assistant) I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?
She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...
I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.
Okay, take it easy. (hangs up) That was Keith. we're going to do something next week.
Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane enters)
He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.
Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night. (Rachel shocked)
Thanks, because I would really like... (distractedly puts coffee cup back on the table)
It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make.
(Stops) Alright, that's not gonna work, it's not gonna work. Let me just think for a second here.
Where are you going, you just got here?
Great, its yours. I can't stand the sight of it. Elaine, heres the car keys. (tosses her the keys)
All right, what are you gonna say to him?
You want Little Jerry to take a dive?
First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, "Didn't you see my signal?" "Look at that fender!" ..Then you'd see a real fight.
All right, that's enough of that. (Jerry takes the plates and hands them to a waitress.)
No I can't I've got some stuff to do then I've got to meet Keith at my apartment at three. I'm helping him move.
But its common sense. Hes got super strength, super speed. Im sure hes got super humor.
You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor story??
I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.
How much could you possibly have in there?
(from the back of the club, leaving) That's it I'm calling in the big guns.
So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.
Notice what? She's not really even a maid.
We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC.
That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes for this, okay...
Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for it.
I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.
Hello. Oh! Hi George.......What! ..really! All right I'll call Elaine , we'll meet you down there.
Do you want to go with him? You go. I dont mind.
No, I just wanted to see what time it was.
People dont turn down money. Its what separates us from the animals.
(to himself) I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles. (answers phone) Hello.
Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'
(to the Barneys sales associate) Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions?
Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.
I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or somebody? What's with this guy? (Gino looks at him annoyed) Just asking.
Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!
Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.
What happened to the jacket. Did he take it with him?
"What are you doing that for, you got a job"
(to George) You know these squeegee-- Oh my God! It's crazy Joe Devola.
Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese food, there's leftovers.
You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had my chance and that's that.
You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts.
(naked, carrying a belt sander) I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here.
You were livin' in the village then, right?
George! Can we focus on the car, here?
Gee, I just didnt expect it from the way youve been acting.
Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.
You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.
Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.
Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.
May I see you outside for a moment please?
That's the last babka. They got the last babka.
He really did an amazing job. Look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid! (Jerry opens refrigerator.) He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups! Come here, look at this. (He gets on his knees and points.) He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there?! He must be like Rubber Man!
Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.
What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.
I'm right here. (note he has an athletic bandage on his right hand) You're late.
(spits the nut) OooH!!! You. you ate these? You sucked on these and put them on the plate?
Well I thought we'd both be getting married.
My bet? All right. Ill open with a tuna sandwich.
You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing!
Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.
(looking after the guys) That nut is always up to something.
(smiling) Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself.
Gasoline? Can't you get it after you drop me off?
I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. (To Elaine) I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure and not watch it.
Oh I'm stressed! (makes like Kramer, outstretching his arm. Jerry heads for the freezer for some ice cream.)
She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?
I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza?
Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.
No, Uncomfortable? Not at all. (ASIDE TO ELAINE) My friend's wife's breast sticking out - why would that make me uncomfortable?
So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise?
Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first thing they ask is who's responsible for this?
Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Bania should be setting pins in a bowling alley.
(Stopping him) No, wait a minute, Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too!
Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really.
Ah, actually, I ka, kinda had some things to do.
Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didnt want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And its been sitting down there for three years until he saw it. (to Kramer) All right, so, just take what you want and lets get it out of here.
Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.
How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!
No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed.
(Kramer waddling out the door) Maybe you can soak in the tub.
Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
I don't know how I feel about it.
Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
What are you doing? You're choking me. Elaine!
What was I supposed to do? You knew I was on my first date with Elaine. You come barging in here asking me to contribute money for a volcano relief fund for krakatoa.
(in a hurry) Yea you're leaving at three o'clock.
Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.
I have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.
You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with. (Kramer enters.)
