Yes. Kelly's was last week, remember?
This looks like a hoot.
Can you put that down there?
This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.
I want a butter sculpture of a cat!
No. I don't want my name attached to this party.
Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack.
Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning!
No! God, Mose! God!
I'm sure.
At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.
Andy, is this you?
I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention to hurt you, but I want to wake you up to the injustice that's going on right in front of your face.
[with Astrid covered in and surrounded by vegetables on a lunch table] That's good.  Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here.  Get the baby to look up here, ready?
That is completely untrue.
Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can���t get enough of the show?  Your jollies are all on fire --
Michael, do something.
Hey everyone, Kevin's going to give us his take on the situation.  Let's listen up.
Oh, really?
You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis!
Good luck, Dwight.
Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!
Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it.
Kevin! That's inappropriate.
I don't understand what you want from me.
Oh, God.
A Catholic schoolgirl?
Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.
You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?
Kevin, come.
[disbelieving] Really?
I feel angry.  Angry at you.  Angry at you for doing something stupid.  Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.
Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?
Cool music.
Then it would say lanch party, Kevin.  Would it really be better if it said lanch party?
Michael! Deangelo has a peanut allergy.
Good night, D.
[on phone] Hello? Hello?
Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar.  I mean I didn't have any, you know, to stay trim.
Oh. [hands Pam tape]
Hey.
[having trouble with a plastic tablecloth as Pam stands idly by] Will you help me?
[watching nearly everyone leave] What about the Halloween party?
Are you drunk?
Come on Clark. [Clark throws plane, Erin throws plane it goes much farther]
No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day.
Is that really necessary?
That doesn't surprise me.
Gladly. I quit.
Okay���
Well, I���ve changed my mind.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Well, I guess it's a big opportunity for them.
What does that mean?
[shaking head in disbelief] No.
You know what? It could go either way. My doctor said my hips are so dainty that I'll most definitely have a C-section, so I could go early.
I mean, unless there's any chance there could be press at this party.
Wha -
I didn't get mine yet.
No! No!
My boyfriend.
He's out sick.
What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?
Stop!
You are. You make your own drink. [Ryan groans]
Sorry.
Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000.
What?
Michael do something about this.
I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave. [removes coat]
Don't blame me for something we all forgot.
[walking past Dwight's desk] Kitchen.
Oscar, don���t rub it in. I���m sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child.
Spray her down?
But, it...
I can't be your monkey, Dwight.
I don���t like your friend Trevor.
Thank you. [plane loops up and falls at her feet] Oh god!
Confetti.
[shivers] [meowing noises] Has this been on the entire time?
What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.
I heard a joke today.
Go in single file lines.
I think the senator is having an affair.
I have a lot of cat figurines on my desk. I think cats, really, are old souls. And, uh, Phyllis thinks so too.
Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.
Forget it. Is that chocolate-vanilla swirl?
Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.
This is not work talk.
Obviously.
I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.
No.
Well, why don't I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead?
Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause.  Do you want to re-mediate?
Right. Anyways... I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone.
Did Roy ever kill one of your cats?
Well, I only ask because he's a senator.
What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?'
Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
If you know something Michael...
I am.
[Gives Dwight a knowing look]
What? Kevin!
Yeah. And I said sorry.
Huh.
Thanks.
When Michael suggested canceling Christmas, I was outraged, not on my behalf, but on behalf of baby Jesus. I mean, would he cancel Christmas because he got dumped or he was two weeks behind on his party planning, on top of the fact that his cats were ill? I think not. I think baby Jesus would suck it up and plan his party.
Stop it! Stop it! You're frightening me!
[Angela slaps Toby on the face.] Stop it.
You won't see-
Yes.
Aw, crap.
You behaved very badly tonight.
People love it.
I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?
Black eye, Meredith.
No, orange is whorish.
I tried. We didn't have time.
Do you even have a mattress?
Ugh.
I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore.
Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring?
OK fine you can have your tent, but only if it's in a field, a hand-plowed field
Ok.
Michael was so right about you. You are pathetic.
Just a few quick things.
[nods]
[sticks a hand in the pool] Oh, it is warm.
Okay, Andy, we get it. It's a trip to Gettysburg.
I'm his! His... wife.
I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.
I already booked a Great Lakes cruise.
Sign.
What are you doing?
Yes.
[throws plane far] Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it's your turn. [Toby crumples plane and steps aside.
I want eye contact.
That was for per diem, for Philadelphia.
Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. 'Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'over here, Angela...' [imitates camera shooting] 'here. Look here!'
Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we're not good together.
I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk.  Would you like to join me?
No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
Okay.
Yes, I'm the designated driver, which is very important. We need everyone to get home safely. [sighs] But no one ever gives me gas money, and people live all over. It's expensive.
Where's Dwight?
Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption.
I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas.  There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.
Is it cool in here to you?
You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?
Oh, God.
Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.
Nana Mimi can't be in canvas that long.
In the Martin family, we like to say, 'Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly.' That's code for 'check out the slut.' What is... why are there flies in here?
Oh...
Sure.
He wouldn't have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!
If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person.
Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid.
What?
Is that all?
I wish some of us still had our shoes on.
You alone?  Because I thought together we could---
[Dwight kisses her] Dwight, I can't do this. Dwight!
Can you arrange a meeting?
[still sobbing]
It's OK.
Ugh.
Yes?
