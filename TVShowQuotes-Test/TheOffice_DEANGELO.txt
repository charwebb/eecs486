Thank you Michael, uh, but I will have to pass.
[as Michael pulls over and stops the car] Please don't stop so suddenly, the seatbelt is pressing on my bladder. Why are you even wearing a seatbelt, you're sitting in the backseat, baby.
I mean you don't have a job lined up, so it's not like you have a desk to put 'em on.
This was not, part of the job description!
