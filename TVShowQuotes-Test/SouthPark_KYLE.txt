That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot! 
I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit?
I heard you won't even get in the deep end.
Why would he put anything in your butts?
He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships!
Okay. Today's word is "spirituality." What that means to me is uh- 
We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.
But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!
No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking!
But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that.
You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef.
What? You mean like you don't like the singing, or the lyrics, or what?
No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??
We promised each other we would never do that, remember?
Can't we just play hide and seek at home?
Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up.
Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!
Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go "God damn it, that's a big fat ass!"
Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus!
Hey, that went really well. They really liked it.
I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!
Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe Trent Boyett has forgotten all about it.
Yeah, I don't even know if I'm gonna watch it anymore.
Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh- my fragile little eight-year-old mind didn't know how to deal with what I was seeing. C-Cartman should be punished!
You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair.
She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!
Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast.
Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel. 
Carman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on.
You're saging these games do this on purpose?!
No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket.
We're all gonna pitch in on an entry!Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex.
I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls!
This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.
Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg?
Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there. 
Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!
Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream.
Um...  Greetings from Canada.  Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it?
I got it mail ordered from Africa.  The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three.
It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.
Wow, then you should get money for it!
All right! We're getting the hell out of here! 
It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.
Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.
Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!
Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care.
It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!
Fine! But when you're naked and jackin' it in San Diego, don't ask me for help! 
Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home!
Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip.
You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!
I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for "Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos.
Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap! 
Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?
Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!
Will you get out of my living room, please?!  Hello?!
But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better.
Really sorry about all this, dude.  So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.
Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!
Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Token. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue. 
No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon.
No asshole! From now on you only get to have one power! So what is it?!
It's true.  He doesn't care what faith you are.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
Even if-
Ha, Goddamnit!  Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, 
Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake.
So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday?
A big success?! You can't even get Tyler Perry to go back home!
Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service.
That's us!  "Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies."
Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Token? He's not just staying at their houses?
Pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely. It's what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan? 
Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!
Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid.
Dude, why is your store called "The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?"
That does it! I know what I have to do! 
What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh?
He was with us at dinner. Wait. Was he with us at dinner?
They all laugh at me!  And the girls giggle behind my back!  unable to even glance at my disfigured face.
That's it!  I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it!
Guys, I think we should bail out of this right now!
Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here.  So we made you this cake.  There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.
I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake. 
There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-
I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance.
I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?
My Dad says he can't live here anymore.
Oh for sure, dude! It's the most God-forsaken place on the planet! Things are finally gonna be normal around here.
Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude.
This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!
Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones.
That's it, Stan! I'm not sitting through a whole movie with you! 
Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill.  And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing. 
No, dude! We have to name it Steve.
Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon! 
Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie?
Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card.  You lose a turn.
That was sweet, Bebe.  Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you-
Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast.
Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you!
Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.
We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now!
You just want Family Guy off the air...
Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either.
Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord.
All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend.
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
I hate this town. I-I really really do.
I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.
Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!
Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker?!
You get away from me, you crazy woman! 
Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!
Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchucks of Sokuromoto! 
No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say "Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!"
Dude, look at Bebe.  Something seems different about her.
Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. 
They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending!
No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?
Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday.
Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him.
Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story!
Oh no way! Look!  The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened. 
Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?
Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons.
Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall, he's gonna wanna kill us!
This is what God told us to do!
Mr. Hankey!  Where the hell did you go?
Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!
A ladder to heaven.  We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny.
Ike, you need to have a life. Have fun. Then ruin it by having a serious relationship. 
Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too.
Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!
"We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony, which will be held tomorrow morning at ten. Details and proof of sales enclosed. P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha."  He did it. Cartman got a platinum album.
Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!
What the hell would you know you fat sweaty Mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!
Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit.
Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?
Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!
Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says "Cash For Gold and Jewelry." There must be a lot of people doin' it.
Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.
Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!
Excuse me, but Ike has homework he's supposed to be doing.
Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?
Trent Boyett will do it. He's the toughest, baddest kid in preschool! 
You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!
Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?!
The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!
Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?
I promised my mom I'd let him try. 
Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!
We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four....
Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten.
Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us.
Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality! 
I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.
Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? There's got to be a morning after.
I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!
I mean, yeyou people are all just such hick jock rednecks; it's just like you right out of a stereotyped catalog.  Ah I can't take it. See ya. 
Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up.
Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.
You guys!  You gotta help me. These business casual G-men are trying to kidnap me!
No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic. 
Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?
Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard!
Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche. 
Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!
Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!  Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long.
Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! 
So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?!
Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!
Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!
Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad.
No, that... I thought that was a lot.
That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it.
Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?
Come on Stan, don't you even know where you would go?
"No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!"
You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars.
The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that!
Alright, look. I honestly don't know the secret, dude. Only Cartman does, and that's how it's gonna work for us.
You mean you can see him?  Ah-I'm not crazy? 
"No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies."
Yummy yummy yummy can I please Cartman's farts in my tummy?
Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!
How dare she talk to us like that?!
I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me.
Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you?
But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?
Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus.
What? How the hell do I only have 37 friends?
...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed.
Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it.
My God-damned little brother's trying to follow me to school, again!
Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship.
I, I know it's tough but-  Look at me!  I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now!
Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!
I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's being an asshole!
Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history.  You see, history is forever,  and everything happens for a reason.  Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-
We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults.
We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with my parents. They'll never know.
Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore!
Good thing we made those changes to the seating.
We put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft.
Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I will play
Second verse, same as the first
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidelll-I ma...
W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of town.
Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!
Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!
We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed.
You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy!
Well what are we supposed to do with it?
No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime!
Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there.
Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay.
I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.
Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family.  I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are.
Wait! You know what we should do? We should all take a bunch of cough medicine!
They laughed hardest at our video. We're gonna win!  We're gonna win!
Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!
No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall-Mart.
Okay, that's enough.  Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!
Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.  Well, here's Kenny's house.
You won't get more votes than us, asshole!
Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee.
Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!  Come on!
Can you act like you're giving him a lot?
I don't wanna go to your stupid movie premiere!  And don't tape that to my locker!  Oh God. 
I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live with us. It'll be just like having a brother. 
I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.
Ahhh I've seen this before. Whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies, they tell it some kind of paradox, to get its processors all tripped out.
Ike, you can't come to school with me. 
Hey!  How about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo?
You're gonna see it.  WILL SOMEBODY GET ME A GOD DAMNED CHARGER?
Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around?
You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!
How long has it been since you've been back there.
Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now.  Stan?
There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!
This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick!
It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel. 
She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right?
What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!
Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away.
Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok.
Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!
Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.
There's still time to tell the network president you're full of CRAP! 
No! These don't belong to you! They belong to the people!
Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!
Here! Here! Look at this. It says "The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power."
I think I'll add some more... pigs.  Oh, maybe I should put in another field of corn there.  There we go. Nice.  Twenty nine? No, I have thirty friends.  Hey what the hell is-? Oh no! Oh shit! 
But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together? 
Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings. 
"Wanted by U.S. Border Patrol"?! "Permission to shoot on sight"?!
Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time. 
And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??
How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up!
Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us.
Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?
Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?
Oh, just this really really old lady who wishes she was still only 45. 
If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it.
Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!
How many iPod Nanos is friendship worth? I guess, one.
Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!
Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retared Russell Crowe show!
What?? "A-ight"'s not cool, either? When did that happen?
Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school.
We can't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody! Nobody knows we're responsible for Ms. Claridge's accident!
People of all colors and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow!
You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!
But that's stupid.  How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.
Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows.
Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.
Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.
Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans!
Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!
All right.  All right, I guess it's possible.
What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?
Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them.
This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.
You see? And then I can take all my homework on my iPad, and swipe it over to my iPhone.
Ike, I just want us to be friends again.
You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass.
If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!
Well, ah I mean, we have to accept that we have a problem, and put the blame completely on ourselves. I mean, maybe this isn't really even a disease. 
Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. "Washington Redskins" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it.
Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.
It isn't fair!  I don't want to be an outcast!
No I'm not! God damn it Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!
Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny.
Is, is this? Do you think this is cool?
Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him.
This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!
Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!
He must have a huge bone in his ass, then. 
Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it!
...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled.
David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!
And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course.  Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter?
Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?! 
Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville.
I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad.
Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and...  Me?
You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.
Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?
