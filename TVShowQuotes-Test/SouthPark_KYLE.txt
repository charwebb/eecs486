Alright, fine! Let's just get this stupid report over with!
We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.
I was trying to make an appointment to see the principal about getting excused on Friday. So I can take my brother to go see Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause.
Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?!
Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?
NO. Dude, maybe you should see a doctor.
What the hell would you know you fat sweaty Mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!
Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.
We know he's dead. We mean, where is his body??
He catches the feesh so, then he can make money.
What the hell are we going to do??
You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.
I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's being an asshole!
Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch.
Just tell us where Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner so we can kill this stupid rat!
Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it!  It's so simple!
Well!  You're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass!
Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show.
So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go?
Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys. 
Alright dude, we were going to the movies.
You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!
The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that!
You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!
Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!
No, dude! We have to name it Steve.
Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.
He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play.
It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this.
Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use prerecorded tapes.
Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?!
Hold it.  Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops.
Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! 
I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!
I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can. 
Oh God!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to-ah, I'm looking for my brother.  Ike??  What the hell is going on??
Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America.
Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar.
Will you please take your rally conversation somewhere else?
Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need.  Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything.  Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society. What's so unethical about that? 
Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike.  Come sit by me. 
Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters.
You're having nightmares about the ending to World War Z again?
No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.
Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool.
Hey! Hey!  Who the hell told you to put this thing back up?!
Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?
She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight..
Throw 'em away!  Dudes, here he comes. Guys, stop coughing. 
He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!
Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky. 
Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby.
Why?! So that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times?!
Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?
This is it. This one's for the game.
Dude, this is the saddest commercial ever! Don't watch! 
Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet! 
I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance.
...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.
Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember.
Ask her if we get the watch right away.
Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!
Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial.
Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!
I got it mail ordered from Africa.  The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three.
Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool.
We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble.
All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend.
Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more!
Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.
Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!
The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.
Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!
Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.
And then Craig was all like, "Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken." And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken;  well, everybody in the world saw it!
I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here! 
Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history.  You see, history is forever,  and everything happens for a reason.  Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-
Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, take the stupid triangle!
Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials. 
That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!
Yeah, I like him a lot more than Cartman.
How do you know...  that wasn't your therapy? 
We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer!
Aw, don't be such a baby!  You do it, Kenny.
Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this. 
Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes.
Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich?
Ike, there's been a mistake. You don't understand.
No! We can't divide like this!  Stan?  You're on our side, right?
Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em.
Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.
The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this- fruity little club!
Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children.
Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows.
The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.
Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-
...French fries... pizza... french fries...  come on, Cartman.
But how can the Jews make it better??
I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?
But you know, I've learned something today. I've learned that people who want power, a lot of power, always... end up dead.
Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek.
Well, I attend South Park Elementary, ah-and... w-one of the teachers is having sssex with a student.
Come here!  You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!
You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid.
Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!
Yummy yummy yummy can I please Cartman's farts in my tummy?
He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
You were scared Cartman! you almost peed in your pants!
Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him.
Well that goes without saying, fatass, how could she help but look at you!
Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame.
See Cartman, your mom is on the cover.
You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!
Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.
Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, "You know, I learned something today..." and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense!  What is your logic?!  Ow. 
Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots?
Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?
But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear.  Do you understand this?
See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become.
Mom, Dad, have you ever met Ike's kindergarten teacher? 
But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.
No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.
I need to get a nurection for my dad.
Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?
You're okay with everything you think going up on the Internet?
I'm going to break everything that you own! 
Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school.
Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy!
Mom, there's sssomething I need to tttell you.
Oh, my God! What the hell is that thing?! 
No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black.
You're a fat skank, Mom, and your tits belong in a morgue. 
That is not what happened! You totally started crying and quit the game!
Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?
I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money.
They saw us on the tour.  Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?
You're doing the right thing, Stan. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now?
I was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po-
You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!
I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly.
Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. 
You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you.
How many tickets can we put you down for?
No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??
Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up.
Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me:  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?
This is not Mr. Hankey!  This is a fake! 
This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff.
Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.
You mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up.
Well I wish I didn't have any parents! 
All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan like America.
They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die. 
...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!
They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!
Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall, he's gonna wanna kill us!
Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?
Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.
If it'll make you leave me alone, then just take the damned thing! Here!  There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel really, really good about yourself!
I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people!
You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise. 
Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again?
Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear.
So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature! 
Okay. So we put little "woo" mouths on all our heads.  And then we shoot that for one frame.
Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger!
Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks.
Uh, alright then.  Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle.  Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had- 
It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday.
You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay?
Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant.  See ya. 
Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing.
What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers! 
I think you're awesome, Funnybot. Uh, but you can't go around taking everyone else's jobs.
Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality.
You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.
Yeah.  And that means that McGyver is a real person too.
I think the other dog's the one that's confused.
Please, you guys, you don't understand.  My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.
Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?
I don't know how you do it, dude. How do you get up in front of that many people?
Dude, they've been doing that for a long time.
Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you! 
Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I.  I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend.
I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!
And we think that that is  a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?
No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!
You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair.
Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out. 
Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got-  wha-what is it?
Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time.
Butters! He got a ninja star stuck in his eye, and we were taking him to the vet when you fucked it all up! Butters!
What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?
Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house.
Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.
Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children,  just like us.
Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses.  Let's just... put those back on. 
This is it, Stan!  It's just like I designed it. There's the miniature gold course over there! And slides and uh,  excuse me, what is this place?
I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!
No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.
Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes!
No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape!
Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't know anything!
Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things.
Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!
You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!
Hm, I think he took that pretty well, I think.
Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?
Yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores?  And what about all the- 
Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them.
Then just tell me what Cartman is up to!
Ahhh I've seen this before. Whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies, they tell it some kind of paradox, to get its processors all tripped out.
What the hell have you gotten me into?!
What does that have to do with Passover?
Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom. 
Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff.
Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on.  Sshh. 
What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?
Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us.
Well come on! We gotta tell you what happened. I'm sure glad it's over with. 
Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?
Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not.  See ya. 
Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here.  Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?
Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat.
Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry!  Stan? Stan?? 
Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore.
I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream?
No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now!
Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible.
Nobody believes in you, not even my friends.
Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex.
Oh my God! You did lie to me.
Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there. 
I think we can piece this case together now.
Well, c-cause dude, I'm Jewish, a-and you know...
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous.
There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!
Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put up all over signs as the poster child for bullying?
This is what God told us to do!
We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?
It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.
Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.
Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game.
Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going.
Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew! You're a Jew! Shut your God-damned Jew mouth! Good job, Jew! Jew... Shut up, Jew! You're Jewish!! Dude, he's Jewish! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew?! "I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm." "Fuck off, Cartman!"
Do the right thing. Show Mohammad.  Do. The right. Thing.
What? How the hell do I only have 37 friends?
You son of a bitch! I won't let you win!
I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle.
Yeah? Well Butters is ten! He doesn't exactly know what's best for him and neither do you!
"We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony, which will be held tomorrow morning at ten. Details and proof of sales enclosed. P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha."  He did it. Cartman got a platinum album.
Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too.
I don't know what else to do, dude. No matter what I try, me and Ike just seem to drift further apart!
I can see clearly now, the rain is goneI can see all obstacles in my way-
That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!
Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny.
Jesus, I can't do anything.  I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government.  Uh, hello? Jesus?
Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman. 
If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong.
Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!
Come down here, you stinking aliens!  Uh, uh...
Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something.
We found it, you guys!  Oh no, they followed us! 
What are we supposed to do with him?
No, the nipples are more in the middle, see? 
Not when  if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away.  No, go away! Bad dog!
Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team.
It's not new!! I'm gonna look "shit" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!
This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this! 
I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.
Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!
Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!
We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.
Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.
Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together!
Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike! 
Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson.
This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman.
This has gone far enough!  How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!
Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth!  Mooooomm! 
Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!
I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen! 
We're making the news more appealing to students.
I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GOD-DAMNED LEPRECHAUN!!
Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now.  Stan?
There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!
Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else!
You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people!
...Remember when life used to be simple and cool?
Hey dude, ah are you the guys messing with Cartman's stuffed animals?
Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.
Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary?
Twenty... million?  Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money.
He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--
Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!
It wouldn't be funny if that Web site posted something about you!
If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!
Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.
Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?
Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there.
Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year.
Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea.
It seems like I might get splinters, though.
Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up.
No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!
That's it.  That's how our parents broke the passcode. I never thought anyone would stoop so low!
Ugh, okay Stan, what do you wanna do?
Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us.
Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass.
Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.
