What does that have to do with Passover?

Mom, there might be something that you should look into about Ike staying after school all the time-

How?

Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid.

Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute!  Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?

Mookie-stinks?

Totally! I totally understand!

No!

What are you guys doin'?

What Butters? 

What are we doing?

That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it?

Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life.

Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?! 

We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!

Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?!

Crud! 

What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?

Holy shit, dude!

Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him.

Kick ass, dude!

-bring me back my little brother, God damnit!

This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen.  Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,... 

Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.

He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.

No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!

Dude, maybe we should give up!

Fine!

What is a meth lab, anyway?

Aw, how the hell should I know?

Yeah, sure. 

What?

Yeah! 

Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade.

I can't believe my parents are cannibals!

When is Mr. Hat coming back?

Now what?

Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing.

The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!

Where's your lunch, Butters?

What are you doing?

These are gas masks, Butters!

Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems.

You'er not staying at my house either.

No! Hey!

Right. Except for it really isn't.

Dude, this sucks ass!

Be sure to take me to the same hospital!

Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that...  flicker of light over there?

Look guys, all we need to do is split up and apply some good diversion tactics. We'll use the Texans' emotions against them.

Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!

Oh.  No you didn't!

Cartman! You saved us! 

Satisfied with-  Wait a minute. What medication?!

God-damnit! 

I'm not going back.

Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.

How dare she talk to us like that?!

I'm just doing the line.

Kenny! 

Huh?

You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!

I'm not done yet.

Who is Cupid Me?!

Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother.

What'd he say?

Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave.  Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening! 

Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!

I made you out of clay.

They're saying something about taking over the entire country.

Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?

I will!

...Alright, that does it!  This has been bothering the hell out of me!  I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!

You've been on your fucking phone since we started!

Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?

Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally.

Aww come on! This is ridiculous! 

Cool.

NO. Dude, maybe you should see a doctor.

God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!

Mr. Hankey!

Kenny ate all the mints, dad.

Let's go somewhere. 

That poor kid.

What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?!

I know, I know. Be cool.

Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient.

God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!

I am so confused.

Not us. We're good kids.

Calm down, dude. You're upsetting Kenny.

Everyone is watching everything.  Ike?  Ike, if you can hear me, I'm sorry. I have been a grandpa.  I didn't understand the things you are into and I and I thought you should like the same stuff that I did.  I have to accept that you're gonna have your own things. I just didn't want you to watch HIM. I just... I just wanna be a family again.

Your wiener is not 13 inches long!

No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime!

This is gonna be sweet!

Whoa, dude!

All right, where are the missing ballots?!  President Obama?

Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?

Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?

You're on, dude. 

The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.

What's your name dude?

We're trying to raise money for our school chef.

The fight is over, Cartman!

Oh Jesus! 

Marvin... 

I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing.

Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you.

We don't even understand how this game is played.

Don't fail us! We'll be right there!

Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care?

Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas.  I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle.

Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one.

If you visitors can hear me- 

Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight?

No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking!

Cartman! 

What the hell? 

Maybe she's in the lunch line.

Hi. I've uh...  I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this.  It's twenty dollars. 

Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough.

But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?

No, ah I don't.

Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting Family Guy off the air.

No. You're thinking of somebody else.

That's correct, Chef.

I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin? 

I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad.

Yeah. That makes it even worse.

Yeah. It happened once before.

Kenny? Kenny?!

Chef, do you know where "shit" comes from?

Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles! 

Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!

Yeah they're the best!

So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?

...Huh?

Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.

Yeah yeah.

Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.

Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here.

Heheh, heh, no problem, heh. No problem!

You see anything, Kenny??

This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?

They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer again!

Holy crap, dude!  Hey look! He's got ice cream! 

But Jews can't play basketball! 

I want two tostadas and mild sauce.

Hello? Oh hey dude.

God damn it, that wasn't my idea!

Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days.

He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship! 

You're all I have left, Stan.

Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.

Oh no...

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't.

No we don't wanna get high!

Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right? 

Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all!

Cartman??

Yeah. Closure.

How's it going?

What am I supposed to do?

I wanted to get Ike out of his room, so I invited all his friends over for a slumber party to play Dragon Age: Inquisition.

Are we getting close?

Noo! No!

Butters, I think you should reconsider this.

Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 

Ugh, okay Stan, what do you wanna do?

My name. Is not. "Kyel."

We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four....

Huh wuh, what's the matter?

Aaaah!

Yeh-hah. 

I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon. 

That's just how God is.

...What?

Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend.

That guy's a pretty good wrestler.

Oh no! 

They laughed hardest at our video. We're gonna win!  We're gonna win!

What the hell did you do??

...What?

Like what?

What?

Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late!

I do not sound like Cartman goddamnit!  Okay, so, see ya. 

Dude! He's making ice cream. 

We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik!

He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.

Uhhh, we aren't cops or anything.

Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!

How?

What have you done?

You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you.

I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up.

Chef should be here any minute.

Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth.

If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine.

Yeah. 

Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike.

What's a "quin-tuplet"?

Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office!

A break from what?! You haven't done anything!

You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?!

Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation.

Just get out of here!

Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say.  You can tell them...

I agree with Cartman!

He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over.

Okay.  N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 

I don't start, you start.

What happened? It just didn't work out?

Good point. 

Let's do this! One! Two!

Chef!!! 

No! Up yours, fatboy!

Nah. Dude, I totally spaced it. 

Beause he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath!

Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said "shit" on television.

Kenny! You're alive!

...Dude!

Ungh, it said in my book that the word, "shit", started exactly the same time as something called, "The Black Death".

This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!

Oh, really?? 

Could it be?

Here we go again.

But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity?

Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me.

What do ManBearPig droppings look like?

But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?

Alright, what is it?!

Whoa, look at that.

Cartman.  Kenny's in the hospital.

Just come on! It's getting dark.

Alright, dude, take off the headset. 

Hey, look! 

What the hell are you talking about?!

But I thought you hate us.

Really??

They are?

Going to Afghanistan? Locked in a small space for 20 hours? How could things get any worse? 

That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.

Sure. Come on, guys. 

What?

You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!

Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little.

Stupid supremacist asswipe!

What the hell does that have to do with American history?

That isn't it, Cartman.

Yeah, I guess so.

No, fatass, I came to get my brother! We all have to get out of here! It isn't safe.

Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard!

Stan? Stan, I think we should talk.

That's not what I meant!

Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside.

NO, Cartman!

Hey!

Go away, Mr. Hankey.

Hepatitis B?

Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park.

I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?

Awww, go on and do it already!

Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now. 

What?

City of Brentwood
They take really good care
of all their homeless

...No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened?

What?

Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly!

Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary?

Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one.  Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody? 

Mom?! Where is Ike?!

Hey!

Ex-cuse me?! If my little brother has been getting some athlete's hormones, then who has been getting Ike's medication?!

AAHH!

No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter!

It's... big.

Dad, if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it, what do you do?!

It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.

Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?

What?!

Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek.

We're singing about a dreidel.

Yeah, with butterscotch. 

Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you. 

An apology?!

What?

Uh…yeah…we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.

They're gonna say "shit" on television?

Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!

Look, up there.

That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?

I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me.

Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids.

Go Cartman! 

Dude, he's farting fire!

Hey, Stan!

What am I, Mom?

This must be it. "Cleo Broflovski" That's my grandma. 

Thanks for seeing us, sir. My friend is really worried about his dad.

I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people.

Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus.

Yeah.

Okay, sorry, sorry.

No way.

Wait a sec. Where is your producer?

Can I come in?

Yep.

Aaaaah! Gross! 

Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. 

No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon.

What the hell is wrong with these people?!

I was in the bathroom when you were talking to Butters, Cartman!  I know what-

...Totally what?

Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.

Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones.

Whoa, hang on! We shouldn't be learning how not to get caught. We have to take responsibility for our actions. 

Yup.

Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men.

The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side.

Ask him what hell is like.

Dad, how could you?!

I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.

Are you old Frida?

Whoa, dude! 

Uhuh.

Guys, I'm really worried about my brother.

We need help! Our friend is in a coma!

What is it, Butters?

Yeah, I like him a lot more than Cartman.

Ike, I do! I just-

I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.

Why do you need me?

Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!

God damnit!

Ahhh!

Well, Ike. You can tell Cartman that it's my triangle!

We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!

Yeah, probably 'cause General Tso's chicken. 

Suck my balls, fatass.

It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!

It's a boy! 

Weird

God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-

The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.

I know. I deserve it.

Not now, Mom. Please.

Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-

See? I told you it would work. 

What do you mean, fatass?

Come on, we've gotta go!

I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid.

... Uh huh.

Yeah!

Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

I got through. Hello, police?

Cartman?? Cartman, you see anything??

Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?

I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass! 

Hey, Cartman.

There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude. 

It wouldn't be funny if that Web site posted something about you!

Okay, go ahead. 

All right,  check it out, I-  Butters, BUTTERS. What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!

Goddamnit! Goddamnit!

Good job, fatass!

Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!

-And I'll stand. 

Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous.

That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.

Uuuuh. Stan?

Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong with Cartman.

Let's go. Oh my God, that smells good. 

How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate?

Okay. Today's word is "spirituality." What that means to me is uh- 

Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!

Yes they are! I have an idea.

Ah, dude, weak.

Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.

Could we go home now, Ma?

What??

-And I'll stand. 

Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?

Ah, alright.

We found it, you guys!  Oh no, they followed us! 

I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!

Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.

We're with you, dude.

Well this sucks!

Thanks, Mr. Garrison.

Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!

I can't believe he's gone.

What?

Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.

No, I just don't think it's healthy.

We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!

Watch out Stan!  Genetic engineers are crazy. 

Maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or they'll die.

Hello. 

Nooooo! 

Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory.

Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?

What about you?

Yeah!

Oh wait! We forgot the necklace.

I'm in big trouble, you guys! We have to do something!

So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?

Hey! What are you doing?

Who are you?

Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.

But I have to get off!

Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys.  Hi, are you Elton John?

Ike, look out! 

They aren't gay? Then what are they?

No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more. 

I told you guys.

Do you know how to start a fire?

Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!

No they don't!

The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.

You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do.

Did you make it to your job interview?

Wait wait it-it's Stan's birthday.

Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!

Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please.

Yeah! We did it, you guys! 

Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now?

Ha! You see?!

Wing?

If it needs to be seen by everybody, then why don't you put it out on the Internet for free?!  Well?!

Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over.

What? Why?

Guys.  Guys, I need your help.

Oh, okay. Cool. 

Whoa, dude..!

Um... so...  So dual citizenship, wow, uh... You know that I, I never knew anyone that had that.

You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude! 

Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.

Uh...

N-no, I'm just saying that I think-

Hike!

I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing.

Cool! Now let's try the script!

We've just gotta stick together.

Huh?

No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth!

Her life belongs to us!

What did Cartman tell you?!

The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this- fruity little club!

You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!

Dude, we aren't going to kill you. 

So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike?

Wuwhat's going on?

Kenny's sick?

Uhhh...

I can't believe how cold it is out here.

What?

Yeah.

Attack! 

Wow! 

Ih ih ih-t's g-gay?

Are you sure you're all right?

No.  But I get Channukah presents for eight days.

Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.

Gone are the dark clouds that had me-

...Dude, what?!

So you never met your mom?

Will you stop saying that word?!

Is it like a- haunted house or something?

Hold on everybody. This thing isn't even a-

Oh God, get me off of here!! 

I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.

I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can. 

You don't get sucked into it! You don't get sucked in at all! Plehehehehehehehese!

Haaaah! 

About what?!

How do you know? You weren't even there.

Go away!

Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. 

It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.

Totally. 

Dude, our town is going to be better without the-  What the?

Stop saying "hella," Cartman!

We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey. 

It was really important for me to get an A, Stan. And Bebe said you were so reckless with your egg, so I made a fake one for you  and kept the original safe with me.

There doesn't have to be...

What?! Are you serious?!

It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.

What the hell have you gotten me into?!

You're not the teacher, fatass.

Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!

Dude, we have to get to the mall!!

Better than being a fatass Texan!

The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!

And asshole.

We're not basing research for our report on this crap!

Oh, God! 

Whoa, what the?

Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there. 

Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies.

You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!

It's a turkey.  His name is Gobbles.

You're keeping that money yourself?

Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?!

It isn't fair!  I don't want to be an outcast!

Yep, that's great. 

It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet me!

Ah I was just trying to... just, just in one instance... No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 

It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together.

Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs!

You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!

Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!

Come on, you Frenchy little frog!

Aw, God-damnit!

Wait... stop it, stop it!  I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.

All Wall-Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back.

Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso!  You're goin' to the hospital!

Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up.

What the hell is that??

Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there.

Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween.

I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream?

Ike, please. I know your first love seems like the only love, but trust me, it's not. You have so much life ahead of you. 

No!

Four.

Ike?  Oh crap Ike?

Craig just called you a boner!

Aw, that's just a rumor. They don't really track y- 

Yeah... You know, it seems like something's still not right. 

Who is this?

They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer

So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?

But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?

Cartman, he's crazy!

Why?

Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!

Did they say if it's waterproof?

...Uh oh.

Hey, hey, look at this. 

Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?

What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.

You're lying!

Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together!

Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?

Who the hell is that?

No... No!  No...

Alright, then. 

Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!

You made hamburgers? Well that's awesome! I'd love one.  Mmm. Hm, wow  This is really good, Cartman.

A reindeer?

Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche. 

Does anybody even go to Blockbuster anymore?

I'm not going to help you freeze yourself, Cartman! It's a stupid idea!

Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too.

Yeah. That's not cool, dude. 

See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines.  Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out.

Come on! We've gotta make another one! 

Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something?

You BAStard! You BAStard, Stan! 

Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him.

Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!

Sick, dude!

We need to get our friend to a hospital right away!

What are you doing, Cartman?

We need some more fur.  I think that's good.

Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials. 

Yeah.

What?

It's all just in your head, Ike.

I don't believe it.

Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough! 

Just don't mess with it, Cartman.

And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?

-And I'll whittle.

I'll bet you can't.

Oh, man, I don't feel so good.

Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes!

Crack baby... basketball.

Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities.

Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone. 

The fatass. The mayor.

Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason.

Eewww.

...Chef?? A-are you okay?

I have to show you something.  I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.

Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?

Uh, can we sit down?

No, no dude, it went up there.

Yeah! Go Stan!

You don't?

So what are you doing?!

Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall?

You still didn't get a costume Kenny? 

Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!

But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit.

Whoa!

Will you please take your rally conversation somewhere else?

So what happens to us now?

Corn harvest!

Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it?

STOP!

We're not interested, thanks.

Wow! That was easy.

One please.

Boobs are stupid!

I told you guys he'd be here!

Dude, he's not gonna swing! So just throw balls. That way he'll have to walk to first base. 

Yeah... Chef, what's "laid"?

Good.

It's out of control! 

Lame

Is he bigger than a regular clone?

But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments? 

Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If we're wrong, we burn in hell.

Sir! Mister television executive! Stop!

That's just a guy's penis too!

Well what are you gonna do?

That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!

But Muhammad can't be seen dad.

Huh?

But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do. 

You got your period too, Kenny?

Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!

What's going on?!

Washington Redskins?

Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this.

All right, hit it.

Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him.

Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman.

So where's the KFC now?

Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on.

No it's not cool!  My mom won't let me keep him in the house.  She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch.

Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!

Pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely. It's what happened to Laverne & Shirley.

No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about!

All right, now everybody take a tablet and a pencil.  and when all the ideas start coming, just write 'em down. We might not remember everything otherwise.

What?

I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.

There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally.  Cartman? ...Cartman? 

I think we ditched them.

I don't believe it.

But it's true, dude!

What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against.

Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us. 

I just... thought it'd be nice.

That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee.

Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me! 

Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus?

That's what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess. They take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads.

Sooo, what's phase 2?

You know what you assholes like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!

Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now.

Hi, Mom!

What?? No, no, I mean, I-

Get. Outta here! 

D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!

Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did.

Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?

Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.  Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.

That's pretty cool, dude!

We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer!

What?

Why aren't the cops coming in?

"No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!"

I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita.

Don't hurt anybody, sir. We could try and fix this.

Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!

Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant?

That wasn't quite ten seconds.

You don't have any powers!

It's poetic justice.

Gah, I just don't get it.

Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got.

(Sick!)

Hello?

Chef!

Dude. You have sex with children.

Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake.

Cartman, what's happened?

Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.

Hey, that went really well. They really liked it.

'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows.

Hold it.  Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops.

Hey!

I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!

We're sorry.

You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?

Well Stan, you want to know what I think?

Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?

Yeah. Well, she likes Ike a whole lot.

No asshole! From now on you only get to have one power! So what is it?!

Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house.

What do you mean, "can't"?! You made it work; just build us another one!

It says, "Read Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--" What's this word?

Cartman!

We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!

Hey! We're in Canada!

Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on!

All right. Butters, go get next to her.

But the window isn't locked.

Cool!

What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting.

Hey guys!

Mr. Jefferson!

Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it.  What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go outside. People should just go outside. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family

Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna.

Dirty bitch.

Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy.
