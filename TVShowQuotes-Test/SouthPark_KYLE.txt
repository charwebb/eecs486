You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!
Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! 
I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word "shit" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, "The Black Death".
Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?
Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike! 
Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap! 
All right, now everybody take a tablet and a pencil.  and when all the ideas start coming, just write 'em down. We might not remember everything otherwise.
Uh, could you use it in a sentence?
We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.
Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient.
Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention.
But before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog. 
Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time!
Ike! Ike! Wake up buddy! Wake up! Ike, you've gotta wake up, please!  Eh there you go. That's good.  Oh Ike. I thought I lost you, little brother.
Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.
You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.
Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.
Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!
Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!
We put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft.
We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with my parents. They'll never know.
Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium
See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival.
God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house!
Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!
The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. "Curse words" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.
Just make sweet love down by the fire.
You mean that we're forced to pay for the Oprah channel?
When I say "go," you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?
I think he wants us to get in.
We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-
Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how.
You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?
Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich. 
The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded.
Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?
Wow, then you should get money for it!
Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems.
That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!
No it's not cool!  My mom won't let me keep him in the house.  She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch.
"So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea."
But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!
Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out!
You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, "shit"! I think it might have something to do with people dying!
Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water.
We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible!
Hey!  How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends.
Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?
Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.
Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened.
Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!
I do not sound like Cartman goddamnit!  Okay, so, see ya. 
I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!
Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game.
NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-
But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.
When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?
Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip.
Well you made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch!
Why would he put anything in your butts?
Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for.
Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?
Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us. 
You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Token, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??
How come the visitors aren't coming for him?
There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad.
Oh no.  You're not stinking up the entire boat! You're taking a crap off the side into the water!
Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.
Yeah, sorry dude uh, I can't make it either.
With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?
Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help.
That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners.
Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for?
I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money.
We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom.
Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care.
Here.  We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you. 
I don't know what else to do, dude. No matter what I try, me and Ike just seem to drift further apart!
It says, "Read Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--" What's this word?
I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?
Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?
You were scared Cartman! you almost peed in your pants!
Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive. 
Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was. 
How can they make a show out of this? I wasn't even agreeing with them. 
We promised each other we would never do that, remember?
Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Clearly, something's going on.
Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost.
Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy?
Man, it's really starting to snow.  I hope they don't close the roads.
That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.
Cartman released the PS4s Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them.
I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy. 
You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons!
Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going.
Stop it! Stop!  Oh God! Oh God, help us!
We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood.
We're making the news more appealing to students.
I promised my mom I'd let him try. 
We d-didn't think it was that big a deal.
Yeah, but something is wrong with my brother and it might be your fault!
I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.
Couple of days?  But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.
Well that goes without saying, fatass, how could she help but look at you!
Wait. Stan?  Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality?
Because you just said, "here in my room"!
Fine! But when you're naked and jackin' it in San Diego, don't ask me for help! 
Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?
Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career!
Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass!
Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.
Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?
All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all.
This is Cartman. I have to take it.  Hello?
It seems like I might get splinters, though.
Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!
No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right. 
They're saying something about taking over the entire country.
Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny!
Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville.
I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do.  And I, again, am alone. 
There's still time to tell the network president you're full of CRAP! 
Can we please just try and talk to him?
You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems.
I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad.
What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it?
He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over.
You must have a mom.  You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what?
Hi, we'd like to speak to a  Professor Teabag? 
HAHAHAA! Now I shall rule the --  Aww. Uuugh. God it burns! AAAH! My soul is on fire! Whoa! Oh, I don't like this!  I didn't know it would feel so... dark and evil!
Oh wait. Hey AWESOM-O,  I'd also like some celery sticks chopped up two inches long, with peanut butter and raisins on top.
How about we revamp the name? Super School News sounds dry.
That's what they're talking about on the news!
What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!
We need him to win a bullriding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?
Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex.
Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't know anything!
Yummy yummy yummy I want Cartman's farts in my tummy.
Hey, Butters!  I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite  YOU before anybody else.
How come the visitors aren't coming for him.
The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side.
Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.
I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?
Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? There's got to be a morning after.
Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?
Uh, alright then.  Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle.  Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had- 
Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.
Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me. 
Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up.
I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me.
Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!
"No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!"
Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them.
A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?
Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchucks of Sokuromoto! 
The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!
And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course.  Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter?
But we found a frozen ice man from the past! 
Just stop it!  Stoop iiit!!  There's a logical explanation for that.
If it needs to be seen by everybody, then why don't you put it out on the Internet for free?!  Well?!
So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it!
Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in "Heaven versus Hell."
Why are they doing us one at a time?
Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!
Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you?
The water tank?   Hey I'm not going with you!
He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!
It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together.
I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this?  Did it start with fat people on scooters? Or did the bar get lowered way before that? And then I started thinking, maybe it was us.  I don't know, but maybe somehow, we lowered the bar, a long time ago.  And now we're all sittin' here in the stink of it all.  There's no going back, Stan. 
Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny.
I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.
That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years!
I just wanted to see if maybe you want to do fingerpaints with me.
Aw, don't be such a baby!  You do it, Kenny.
Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you.
Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore!
I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GOD-DAMNED LEPRECHAUN!!
But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!
I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all!
What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!
Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am.
Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-
That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?
I can do it. It just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true.
Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!
You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!
I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.
Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal?
I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.
You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole! 
Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need.  Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything.  Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society. What's so unethical about that? 
If you don't show Mohammad, then you've made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at, and what isn't. Either it's all okay, or none of it is.
But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow..
The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!
No, dude! We have to name it Steve.
All right, all right, I was not responsible for 9/11!  God-damnit!
This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up. 
Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob!  Aw, aw, awww!
No! These don't belong to you! They belong to the people!
Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh.
He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!
It's funny that something that should be completely private is put up on a Web site for everyone to see??
Wull yeah, but ah-I got my brother back.
I need you to keep quiet about this, all right?  My little brother and his tea-
Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes?
They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're...  they're raping him! 
I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- 
Dad, if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it, what do you do?!
Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?
We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.
You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go!
What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens.  You farted. 
Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things!
Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig?
Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. 
Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on! 
But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!
But you know, I've learned something today. I've learned that people who want power, a lot of power, always... end up dead.
Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!
Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always.
I heard you won't even get in the deep end.
Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?
Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?
I don't want you to jump them, retard!
Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.
What the hell is wrong with these people?!
You guys don't understand! His wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl! They pass notes to each other in the classroom, they have sex at her house over lunch break,  and during class they sneak out and kiss in the hallways! 
Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.
I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can. 
It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster.
Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there.
I can't believe they would put a fake Mr. Hankey in a mall! If Mr. Hankey ever found out, he'd be so pissed!
Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula!
Kenny, we need to have a serious talk.
No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school.
We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?
I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!
Oh, God.  Wuh. Aah. Get out of here!
Stop being a pouty little bitch 'cause you lost, Cartman!
Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.
You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.
I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day.  But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone.
Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore. 
Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go.
Oh that's,  yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one...
I was trying to make an appointment to see the principal about getting excused on Friday. So I can take my brother to go see Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.
Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy!
Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. 
Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you? 
You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!
Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um,
Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!
I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary.
Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!
Yeah.  HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH?
All right, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day we remem- aw, screw it! 
Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?
Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.
If it'll make you leave me alone, then just take the damned thing! Here!  There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel really, really good about yourself!
What do you mean? We thought she was with you.
Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me! 
I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name "Billy Mays" over and over again.
No, it's still just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how lame he is.
They told us that "Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day."
No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends!.
Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad?
You wanna bet?  Let's go ask my Dad right now!
Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!
Sweet. I made mine go off the jump. 
Mom, there might be something that you should look into about Ike staying after school all the time-
Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...
It was really important for me to get an A, Stan. And Bebe said you were so reckless with your egg, so I made a fake one for you  and kept the original safe with me.
In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies.
Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!
That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous.
Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about!
Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!
"Dear Mommy and Daddy: I am running away. I am sorry, but I can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life. Everyone at school is a fucking idiot, and if one more person talked to me about that Susan Boyle performance of Les Misérables I was going to puke my balls out through my mouth. I love you all, but I have to move on. I'm going to Somalia to be a-" to be a pirate?! Oh shit!
We told him to grow up. So he got rid of his stuffed animals.
Hey, excuse me, but we need some help.
Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is?
When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society
Hey. You're right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman. 
Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball.
Oh, man. I can't just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, "Where's your brother, Kyle?" "You weren't looking out for your little brother, Kyle?"
On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. 
He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.
What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?!
Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strnagers?
Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars. 
Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said "shit" on television.
Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy... 
Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?
Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em.
People of all colors and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow!
I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that.
Look everybody, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we can do something about this. There's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television. And it is password-protected with a security code that only a child would know.
It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.
All right, it's decided. Let's all write in "Giant Douche."
Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?
What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
They said that Chef works in one of these buildings 
Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend!
Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus?
You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?
Sister, you don't know the half of it.
What would we use a marble sack for?
But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!
So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-
That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!
