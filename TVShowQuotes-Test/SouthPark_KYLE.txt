You were scared Cartman! you almost peed in your pants!

A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!

Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad.

Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always.

What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?

Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!

Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff!

We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers.

He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!

Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.

Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams.

I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!

Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States.

I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then-

I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans!

Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this.

We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.

Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars.

Well, I just figured you'd vote for my guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?!  Puffy!

Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!

Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. 

It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any games
And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree
or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas
Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas

Will you get out of my living room, please?!  Hello?!

I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.

Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast.

Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts!  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!

That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!

Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the visitors are sure to come!

I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word "shit" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, "The Black Death".

All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.

Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands.

I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous.

You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!

But before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog. 

Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you.

All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?

See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become.

And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??

Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast!  Oh, I did it again!!

This is how they talk to us!  You'd better watch your mouth, kid!

You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!  Damn it, we were so close!

I TIVO every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did.

So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right?

Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk! 

Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?!

Dad, if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it, what do you do?!

Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef.

How long has it been since you've been back there.

Dad.  Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you.

We need you to protect us... from a bully.

Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.

Alright dude, we were going to the movies.

Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. 

It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together.

Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?

Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.

Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?  I mean, no one even seemed to notice.

Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game.

I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- 

I hear your parents might give up selling meth for good.

Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?

Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude.

I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!

We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.

Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?

Dude, why aren't people coming to help us?

Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth!  Mooooomm! 

Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents. 

Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?! 

You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!

He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!

Here, give me that.  "I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond."

How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!

But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!

Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?

Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!

I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!

Well, Ike. You can tell Cartman that it's my triangle!

Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time, then they should learn our language!

Uh. All I did was show her how to-

Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!

It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.

You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!

Yeah, well people should  know that peeing in pools is  bad!

There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!

Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team.

I don't know what else to do, dude. No matter what I try, me and Ike just seem to drift further apart!

What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?

Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!! 

Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!

Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around.

All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan.

Please, you guys, you don't understand.  My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.

Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?

Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!

Then I can give it to my dad. 

Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too! Who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air?!

What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!

I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.

They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop.

Dude, that video is making people act strange.

But it's our game. We bought it together.

Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls,  you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am  never going to suck your balls,  never! So  there!

But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow..

They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!

Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now.

This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!

Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's.

How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus?

What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers! 

See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines.  Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out.

So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?

But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.

She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!

Dude, our town is going to be better without the-  What the?

It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.

I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!

If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!

All right McNuggets!  Did we pick the right rooster or what?!

We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet. 

Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for!  I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay.  No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan.  Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something.  Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it.

You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.

You don't need that! Get off of it.

But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper.  It has five different compartments for each subject in school,  and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek.

Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?

Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing.

But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!

Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!

Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!

Oh my God, what if I'm not real?

Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.

Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!

Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move.

Oh God, what have I done?!  I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist.

Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall?

Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house.

That's it Cartman, I'm outta here!  Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends! 

Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship.

Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.

Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off.

Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it!

We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik!

The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that!

No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!  Get up!  Get UP! 

It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.

We have in our possession something of great power.  It is... The Lord of the Rings.

Did you make it to your job interview?

Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer. 

Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous.

Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how.

Yeah. And I think I figured out why.

Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?

We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice.

Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!

No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!

Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention.

Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality! 

I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake. 

I can do it. It just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true.

We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!

Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore. 

I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!

Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!

We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and-

Ha, Goddamnit!  Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, 

I just didn't think it would come so soon.

Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!

What?  You mean the missile defense program?!  Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!

And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining.

I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass!

Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!

Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-

Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him!

That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche.

Don't you "Oh, brother" me! She's the woman of my dreams!

Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman! 

Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky. 

THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!

Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something?

I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one.

Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!

We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?

Hey Token.  You-you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters? 

Excuse me, but Ike has homework he's supposed to be doing.

No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President!

Can you act like you're giving him a lot?

You don't pee in the shower, dude, that's fucking disgusting!

Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?

Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!

And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.

Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!

"What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up"?

Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on.

Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?

We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble.

Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend.

You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!

We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!

Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!

Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him.

You said you could get us money, Cartman!

Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!

I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin? 

Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!

Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass.

Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back.

Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman.

Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all.  Hello?

Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!

Oh. Well, come on, we're playing L.A. Noire.

You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid.

Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this?

Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore.

Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys!

Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.

But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?

Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap?

They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.

Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak.

Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America.

"Wanted by U.S. Border Patrol"?! "Permission to shoot on sight"?!

You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage!  You've got cabbage in your muff!  You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! 

They kind of look like us.  I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us.

The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!

Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!

Dah.  Does that mean you'll go to the dance?

How... How did this happen?  Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here?

Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??

Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!

You know what you assholes like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!

No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!

There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-

Yeah, Jimmy's right. I know we can come up with way better ideas than Craig.

Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike.  Come sit by me. 

I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again.  And because we did nothing... they got away.

Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food.

Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it.

Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.

Okay okay... I love having Cartman's farts in my tummy. I love it.  I love it sooo sooo much.

Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass.

Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!

Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!

Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one.

It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid.  Ow.

I think we can piece this case together now.

Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?

Alright, ahhh, why don't we do something else?

You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy!

I don't know if that's gonna be too easy. 

That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it.

We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.

Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid.

Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.

The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.

Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike! 

That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!

You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW! 

Jambu! Jambu, I'm back!  How are you feeling?  Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships?  Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here?

Mr. Hankey!  Where the hell did you go?

Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains.

It's not new!! I'm gonna look "shit" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!

Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! 

Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! 

Geez, all that from a stupid video show.

Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station.

Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan.

Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?

Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him.

Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch.

But how are we gonna get to the North Pole?

Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!

Yeah.  And that means that McGyver is a real person too.

Whoa whoa wait a minute!  This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever?

I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen! 

Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!

It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.

Dude, why is your store called "The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?"

And Cartman for having a whore for a mom.

You wanna kill me?! Fine!  I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! 

Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve.

Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did so our parents could help us! 

I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name "Billy Mays" over and over again.

Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon.  I don't have to go outside!

Um... so...  So dual citizenship, wow, uh... You know that I, I never knew anyone that had that.

What do you mean, "can't"?! You made it work; just build us another one!

They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!

Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast.

...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?

Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!

Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys. 

All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!  Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!

Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.

Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night.

God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house!

What the hell is wrong with these people?!

I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!

Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!  Come on!

They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?

All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan like America.

You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!

Yeah, check this one out. Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!

Okay. N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 

The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop "muff cabbage".

Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us!

If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!

Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever.

Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home!

No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.

Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality.

This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes.

What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or, or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die?!

Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got-  wha-what is it?

Give me that!  Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
