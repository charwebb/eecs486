Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?
Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!
Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses.  Let's just... put those back on. 
What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!
Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you.
We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.
No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right. 
Ike, I don't care if you wanna grow up, I just wanna be by your side while you do it.
Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!
Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up! 
And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.
This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!
Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go.
I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous.
But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that.
Dude, why is your store called "The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?"
He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the visitors!
Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else.
They saw us on the tour.  Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?
Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework.
I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.
Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him? 
Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special.
Yeah, what kind of name is Pip anyway?!
Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now. 
Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode.
I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff.
Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there.
Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!
Don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park.
All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?
But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear.  Do you understand this?
Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike. 
I got it mail ordered from Africa.  The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three.
It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!
I... because the world is at peace. I must endure.
Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down,  and my own existence fading.
Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial.
How did your date with Ms. Ellen go?
Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?
That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!
Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now?
It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any games
And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree
or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas
Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas
It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!
I'm going to put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it.
I know, butâ€”why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?
Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool.
We found it, you guys!  Oh no, they followed us! 
The odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one.  That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand.
Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault!
Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay.
Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans!
Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy?
Yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores?  And what about all the- 
Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there. 
The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! 
Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!
Hey, you scrawny-eyed shithead, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child!
Kenny, we need to have a serious talk.
Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little.
No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back.
Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back.
Carman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on.
Hey Token.  You-you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters? 
This has gone far enough!  How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!
Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?
Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!
No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say "Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!"
Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett?
The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. 
Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!
We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!
Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him.
Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!
This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.
Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel.
No asshole! From now on you only get to have one power! So what is it?!
I promised my mom I'd let him try. 
Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip.
Huh, Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard! 
Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?
Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?
Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing?
Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!
A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God. 
Ike, I just want us to be friends again.
There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!
Can't we just play hide and seek at home?
No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more. 
Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.
Whoa. Check it out, dude.  It's got little drawings on it.
Dude, this is the saddest commercial ever! Don't watch! 
That was sweet, Bebe.  Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you-
Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?!
I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.
You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!
That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.
Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!
Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee?
No, dude. They only changed "terrorist" to "hippie" to make E.T. more P.C.
Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!
We don't know who else to talk to.
Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith.
No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination.
Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!
He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude.
He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.
Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.
Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?
And Cartman for having a whore for a mom.
Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food.
Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
I can see clearly now, the rain is goneI can see all obstacles in my way-
Beause he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath!
God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW!
Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!
But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow..
Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days.
Ike! You are no longer to watch that stupid little YouTube blogging asshole! Do you understand?! You damn kids following these YouTube commentators is bad enough, but i will not have them invading my living room!
Come down here, you stinking aliens!  Uh, uh...
We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults.
Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?
It was him. It had to have been him!
All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?!
Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?!
Aw Goddamnit, now you've made me miss my ride! My whole day is screwed up because of you! 
Yeah... He must be really sick.  Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico.
No!  I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air!
Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season! 
I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?
Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons.
It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have made it to the hospital. By now our parents probably know we were playing with weapons! We have to get rid of the evidence! 
Cartman?  He's not gonna open it. Break it down.
Nobody believes in you, not even my friends.
Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend.
Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong.
All I wanted was to play one level ofÂ Call of DutyÂ and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.
They on'tday?!  Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray!
I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on! 
I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.
Yeah. Maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week, they'll let us stay on the air!
No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll.
I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to.
Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass.
You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go.  They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something.
Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason.
Well, I attend South Park Elementary, ah-and... w-one of the teachers is having sssex with a student.
It wouldn't be funny if that Web site posted something about you!
He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay.
I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away.
It sure is. Do you want me to watch it with you, Ike?
Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars.
Damnit!  Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??
Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.
We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers.
Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us.
Because you just said, "here in my room"!
Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!
Ah... Oh Butters,  it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning.
"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?" That was Wrath of Khan.
Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad.
Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow?
How are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken?!
Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all!
Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.
Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him.
That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?
Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!
Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!
No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight? 
Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss.
It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid.  Ow.
Well Stan, you want to know what I think?
You need to freeze some of your ass off.
If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it.
We know he's dead. We mean, where is his body??
Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned.
Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled.
Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people. 
What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?!
Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! 
Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about.
It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go.  No way!  This is it!
This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!
Uh-uh-uh what do you mean "they've taken it"? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!
It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House.
She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right?
Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix.
No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him.
Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of. Let's go play with trucks or something. 
Jimmy, you're got to explain to the Germans that this is your fault, not ours!
My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?!
Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob!  Aw, aw, awww!
Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands.
How can they make a show out of this? I wasn't even agreeing with them. 
Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.
Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.
Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast.
Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever.
He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home.
Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window. 
Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok.
I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!  Come on, Ike!  Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.
You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass.
Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him.
Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man.
Oh, my God! What the hell is that thing?! 
You son of a bitch.  You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park! 
Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it.
Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!
Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?
Mom, Ike did it again. I don't know what's going on with him, but, it's like he hates me.
Look, dude, things around here have changed. Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn.
Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table" is holding you back. 
Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.
All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend.
Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond used to be? Where we used to kayak and fish?
I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one.
...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!
Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.
It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is. 
You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!
Okay so, what exactly are we doing now?
Write the number down! Write the number down!!
Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan!
Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak.
That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you!
Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!
Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna.
Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?
Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!
I can't say "ookie mouth" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible. 
Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!
I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin? 
Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me:  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?
How many iPod Nanos is friendship worth? I guess, one.
Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality!Â 
Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of Family Guy forever!
What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!
It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!
Alright dude, we were going to the movies.
Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up!
I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly!  Whoa.
NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-
It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.
You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want Family Guy off the air!
Why's your sister so mean to you dude?
So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late. 
Goddammit Cartman, stop throwin' those stupid poppy-things at me! 
All right,  check it out, I-  Butters, BUTTERS. What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!
We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey. 
Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us.
Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water.
Dude, we've gotta hurry home! The final episode of Lost is on soon. 
They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer again!
Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside.
Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know.
If they give you something small, will you end the strike?
Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!
Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.
Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!  Stan? 
Dude, that new kid is such a douche!
I only got a jar of gefilte fish.
What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?!
Well, let's try the dictionary.  queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef.
Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.
Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um,
What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?
Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did so our parents could help us! 
He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship! 
Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys.  Hi, are you Elton John?
All right, cool.  Let's download some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder. 
Dear Mr. Castro:  I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.
I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?
So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?
Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here!
It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.
This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:
What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube.
Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is?
They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they?
Wow, then you should get money for it!
Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!
Oh dude, we are gonna get it now.
Will you please take your rally conversation somewhere else?
You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you have to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it!
Hey, look!  See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We have to go, dude!
You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver.
Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry.
No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.
Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!
Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough! 
No, Muslims can't show an image of Mohammad.
How come we never get opportunities like that?
Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away.
You said you could get us money, Cartman!
If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!
It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives.
Wow Cartman, the visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school.
Look guys, all we need to do is split up and apply some good diversion tactics. We'll use the Texans' emotions against them.
All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?
Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth.
Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset.
Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people.
That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.
With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?
'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops?
What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!
That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one!
Dude, we're gonna see the new Zoopeeker movie!
You don't get sucked into it! You don't get sucked in at all! Plehehehehehehehese!
The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!
Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!
