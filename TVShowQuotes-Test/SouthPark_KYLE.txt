No. NOO!!

I've tried, Wendy. I've called him, I've been to his house. But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse.

No. Tell me you didn't!

Hoh, boy. Here we go!

Where?

No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall-Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility.

Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat.

What the hell is that lady talking about?

What?

'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!

What??

What's a hard p?

Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no?  You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!

I made you out of clay.

I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass! 

Two, one. Go Cartman!

Well, what do you mean?

Jesus Christ! 

Probably.

Yeah, dude.

Yeah. But isn't Token the only one?

We can't give him over to the gingers!

Give me back my brother! 

Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now?

"Fat tits." That's a good one.

Dude! Those gaywads are on our side?

But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.

Awww, go on and do it already!

Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'.

Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!

All right!

Why?

What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel?

I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!

It's a duck. 

...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!

That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous.

You said you all wrote essays.

What are you saying?!

Yeah, I bet she does.

Gross! 

We were stuck. We were completely stuck. 

See Cartman, your mom is on the cover.

Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso!  You're goin' to the hospital!

You think?

Stop saying "hella," Cartman!  How are we gonna win the contest with a squash?  Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good.

Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,

And all the people we tell.

They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses.

It's not new!! I'm gonna look "shit" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!

I know what you mean. 

Yeah.

Right now.

Aah!

Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9/11?

Could we go home now, Ma?

I'm not hearing that.

Here!  Everyone drink some Mountain Dew!

What?! Get the hell out of here!

Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary?

Really?

A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction.  Oh man, we're in big trouble here.

What?

Whoa, dude, this house is huge.

God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again.

Aren't they ever gonna wake up?

I hate you. 

We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.

Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care.

What the hell are you doing?!

Chef, do you know where "shit" comes from?

Mr. Garrison?

That's you, Kenny. Raise your hand. 

That was such über pwnage

Stan?  Dude, Stan, you all right?

Yummy yummy thank you Cartman. 

Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it.

Plase sir, they're gonna kill our friend!

Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!

Huh, what the hell is that?

What's the Yanogapa?

Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. 

HELP! 

In three hours.

I can't believe he's gone.

We killed Kenny?

You've gotta be kidding me!

Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late!

We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!

What?

Did Cartman just say "shitballs" to the principal?

He isn't actually going to show everyone...

Not when  if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away.  No, go away! Bad dog!

Ask him what hell is like.

If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened.

Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore. 

What'd you say, Cartman??

What?

Who are you?

What are you doing?

Stan!

NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-

Dude, what's going on?

And I got these killer Birken-stocks.

God, that was not cool at all, dude!

Goddammit, Cartman!

We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology!

I only got a jar of gefilte fish.

Stan.

You bastard!

He was a McCain supporter.  It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine.

Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?

Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more!

Uch, I didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun! And I still don't! Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There's another explanation for all this.

Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,
Dreidel dreidel dreidel--

Look! 

Uh, Chef?

Well you made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch!

That's the Catholic Church!

Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!

Let's hear it, Cartman!

But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear.  Do you understand this?

Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program?  How much to take a whale into space?  Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on.  Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?

One ticket to New York, please.

Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.

What was what?

Um, no.

All right, all right. 

This is gonna suck.

Man, he's pretty good.

Whew.

(Oh, shit!)

Uuuuh. Stan?

I know. I deserve it.

I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous.

Alright!

They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!

Uh what are those? 

No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate-  See, I knew it.

Stan?

We don't have time for this! Kenny, keep him away from us! 

Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now. 

Eric, sources are speculating that third-grade student, Pete Thelman , pees sitting down like a girl. We've also got confirmation that Sally Turner  stuffs her bra. And Clyde Donovan has only one testicle.

Boring. Boring. Gay. Boring. Boring.

Yeah, they do!

AAGGGGGHHHH!!

Happy Chanukah, Mom. 

No, Ike!

Who?

Aaww!

Do you think we can still make it in time?

...What? 

Hey! Hey!  Who the hell told you to put this thing back up?!

Watch out! Here I come!

I made you out of clay.

No, you're fat to begin with, chubby! Now you're Texan too!

Uhhhh... Yeah. 

It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.

Let's just DO IT! 

Yeah, but how?

I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!

What the hell? 

What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it?

Well they're doing it!

Well, Kyle, I I gotta go.

Hey Texans! Let me through; we want a treaty!

I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!

Is that fun?

Go on by, Michael. 

Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass.

What about Moses and Abraham?

I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass!

Naww, let's dig up somebody else.

Huh?

We NEED a ride to the hospital!

Why not?

Not him!

I know you don't. 

Woohoo! 

Noo! Wait! You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful monster who only wants Family Guy off the air!

I'm set! Let's do this!

Do you mind?!

Aw, dude. 

No, it's his bris.

Ready. 

Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake.

Then just tell me what Cartman is up to!

Did you ever know any famous people?

You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy!

But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?

Fatass.

It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?

Aww come on! This is ridiculous! 

Sure. 

Oh God...

Whoa whoa wait a minute!  This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever?

Wikileaks.  It says here his name is Wikileaks.

Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames. 

Thanks!

You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever!

Yes, I did!

Do you know how to start a fire?

Get back on, fatass! You have to practice!

This... is insane. 

The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing.

A thousand dollars.

Hello?

Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there.

That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.

We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.

And that's our report, I guess.

Sweet!

No way.

No dude, get away!

The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.

Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you.

Aaaaaaaa!

"What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up"?

Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me!

It's okay. The curse has been lifted. 

That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves.

Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers.

Go, Ike!

Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!

We're not interested, thanks.

Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.

Woohoo!

He can't do crap!

City of Brentwood
They take really good care
of all their homeless

Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett?

I'm better now. 

Bastard.

Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee.

Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you?

What's going on?

Six hours.

Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now.

I need one ticket for my little brother.

But Mr. Hankey seemed so real...

I know.

Code 234

Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you.

How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!

This is Cartman. I have to take it.  Hello?

Towelie is a tough choice because,  even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high.

Wow, these books look cool!

...Sorry

Definition?

What are we doing?

Right, then it was "Imagina-ation, Imagina-ation. Imagina-atio-on" 

And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,
If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change.
Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain
All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea
Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free
I just can't be very happy, that's certain
Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin' 
Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind?
That is my one and only wish.

You fat sun of a bitch!

You will?

Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.

Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened?

Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!

Yeah, we've got school anyway.

But Jews can't play basketball! 

"Krocsyldiphic."

Yeah.

People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!

See?! That sucks, dude!

Coup de grah, Cartman

Dude, what are you doing?!

That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.

No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!

When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society

What??

Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap! 

Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin.

No.

It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing.

Yeah, b-but how?

Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!

No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth.

Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water.

I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.

Nope.

Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home!

Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!

She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!

You threw it away, Cartman!

No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?

No. What's chatroulette?

Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!

I'm not completely sure.

Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it!

Because, he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man

"We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony, which will be held tomorrow morning at ten. Details and proof of sales enclosed. P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha."  He did it. Cartman got a platinum album.

Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?! 

Rebecca, in public school,  we select our... own mate.  In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy.

You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage!  You've got cabbage in your muff!  You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! 

...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair!

Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!

All right, all right. 

You're on, fat boy!

Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting Family Guy off the air.

Look guys, all we need to do is split up and apply some good diversion tactics. We'll use the Texans' emotions against them.

Yeah, with butterscotch. 

We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik!

Come on, dumbass, you can do it!

No, dude. They only changed "terrorist" to "hippie" to make E.T. more P.C.

Sshh, don't scare him.

We need to see the new Prime Minister.

...our hearts.  Kenny? 

Come on. Throw the football, Ike.

What was your paper about Wendy?

What a stupid asshole!

Me.

It's my little brother. He's really changing and I feel like-

We're gong to New York?

Wow, are you gonna do it?

Tweek?

Goddamnit! There has to be a way! 

It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.

Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course.  I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father. 

Who cares about saying whatever you-?

Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet.

Yes sir.

Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?

He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!

"No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies."

You bastard! 

Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!

Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!

Thanks for seeing us, sir. My friend is really worried about his dad.

Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost.

I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people!

You can get high from choking yourself? 

Huh?

We were happy playing Laundromat Owners.

And neither were you, Pip!

No, fatass, I came to get my brother! We all have to get out of here! It isn't safe.

Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah. She's having sex with a boy. 

Butters! No!

Will you shut up about 9/11!

What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?

HA! I knew it!

And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?

Wow! Cool!

Are you okay, Cartman?

It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!

Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything.

Well then,  you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!

I'm gonna buy a Walkman with my half.

You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!

Towelie.

Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty.

Twenty-two people?! All right!

All right, come on guys!

I don't think so.

Sweet. I made mine go off the jump. 

What is it?

We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer!

Haha!

What the hell? 

No.

These producers making a big holiday special!  They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!

Okay you guys, check it out. 

Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!

I do. 

But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.

Fuck you!

They've got the doll! 

We're nine.

I can't take it anymore.  Why do people say "long story short"? They're not making it short, Stan.

Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here.

It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.

People of all colors and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow!

Wooww.

And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!

Mr. Jefferson? 

What?

Oh good. I don't?

You'd better!  Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? Iif he knew the situation, he might e-

Well what the hell do we do?

Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!

Whoopie.

You're getting in pretty deep, dude. 

Bulk up to what, fatass?

Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!

Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents. 

Dude, have you ever heard of whispering?!

Haaaah! 

Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?

Naw uh!

Oh my God, you're right! You're totally right!! EVERYONE! GET A NEW TREND GOING! FAST! #webelieveinyou!

You were, you were right?

You didn't?

Then it's not too late!

I was in the bathroom when you were talking to Butters, Cartman!  I know what-

Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!

Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.

All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!

Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!

You're right.  Jesus, that was fun...

Yeah!

You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!

Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer! 

This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting.

What's he look like?

I don't either.

I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake. 

Hey! We're in Canada!

Yeah, I'm scared.

Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.

Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?!

Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school.

What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!

Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here.

Oh no...

That's a pretty solid idea. But who?

Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too.

Can we go now, please?!

What do you think you're doing?!

How can you say that?

I actually only just said that sarcastically.

But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!

I made you out of clay.

You did, dude! You drank his whole body!

Gut they're the ones risking injury.

These are gas masks, Butters!

Well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.

Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!

AAHH!

Good for you, Charlie!

Wow, I guess this really is a big deal.

There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong.

You're having dinenr with his family? What kind of family has a kid like that?

I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there.

What are you talking about?

...I don't know.

Thanks, dude.

Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey?

Who's going to kill you?

Other than his monstrous size.

Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah! 

But you run the Wall-Mart.

Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter.

Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital.

I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad.

Kyle.

That's a retarded idea, Cartman!

Hey Cartman, I need to talk to you.

Why'd you call us?

Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!

Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are.

Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will.

You've been on your fucking phone since we started!

Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.

Go America.  Go Broncos. 

Yeah. And then we can try the football field. 

Are you sure this is where they said to be?

They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!

Mom, give me some money!

Come on!

Draw two card, fatass.

It's a turkey.  His name is Gobbles.

I just... don't understand it.

How many friends do you have, Kenny?

Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!

Okay. Sixty daura.

A break from what?! You haven't done anything!

Alright then, hu-how do I catch it?

Hey, excuse me, but we need some help.

Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!

That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners.

Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.

Aww crap!

Hey, uh that's, that's kinda cool.

Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots!

...As soon as what's dead? 

What's your name dude?

Oh, Jesus...

Nonono! We need to do this first.

Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman.

Destroy it?

But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that.

Okay. Ready? One, two, three, not it!

Is here. To see me.

It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!

So what are we gonna say?

'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!

What's "ookie mouth"?

Oh my God! Look at his leg!

Mom, there's sssomething I need to tttell you.

Dude, maybe we should end this.

"Oh God it burns! It bur-huhurns!"

Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on.

No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume! 

We don't mind.

Yeah! 

I'm Kyle.

So, he's gonna get it, right?

Now what?

Mom, Dad, what's "muff cabbage"? 

What's it?

No way.

Not us. We're good kids.

Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!

Hey. You're right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman. 

Write the number down! Write the number down!!

Stan! What the fuck?!

I'm ba-ack.

Well?

Meaning what?

She's not worried about you.

Hyeah, that poor, poor thing

No way dude!

We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice.

You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people!

That... was six grand?

That's not what I was trending! They took my hash tag and they raped it! Where is Ike?!

Well what are you watching?

No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.

Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story.

That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!

Dude! Dude okay! Stop! I'm sorry!  Says that you are currently... hosting an online chat party for all your friends.

Probably just another stupid dreidel anyway.

Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.

Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls.

What would we use a marble sack for?

A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God. 

But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!

Yeah, it's pretty cool.

Goddammit, say something!

Right.

Noo! No!

What?

Does so!

Giant Douche is your man!

...Dude, what?!

Fine.

Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?

Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him.

Ugh, okay Stan, what do you wanna do?

They're... they're bastards.

I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus. 

It's okay, it's still the show.

Butters, I really think we should talk.

How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs?

Sure.  What's up?

What is that thing?

Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!

We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool.

Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want.  Who wants to read them? 

Them?

Hey, Cartman.

Ike, look out! 

Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days.

I think we can piece this case together now.

Go away!

No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend.

Dude, this plague is spreading like wildfire! 

AAAAAAAH! I can't take it! 

He's right. It's just a spook story.

Now, the next mouth.

Now, Cartman!! 

There he is!

Oh for the love of God!

Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!

I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me. 

Bill Cosby.

It looks like a UFO.

We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, assface!

Okay. Here we go.  Hey! That was right on target.

Steve!

Fatty Doo Doo?

No way.

No way.

Let's do this! One! Two!

Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy.

You... bastards!  Wha, what the hell is wrong with you?? What kind of Prime Minister bases his decisions on hatred?  And, and takes away mounties' horses?  And French people's wine? What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?!

Uh you did what? 

Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.

Oh no...

Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck. 

A... curse word.

Ike, what's the matter?  Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on?  Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this?

with dreidel I shall play.

What are they doing in there?

Oh dude, we are gonna get it now.

Why?

Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!

We have problems!

But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience!

Holy God, dude!

Oh Jesus, we have to hurry!

But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people.

What? How the hell do I only have 37 friends?

Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother.

No. 

Yes!

Oh my God! 

What's it doing?

Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me.

Watch out for ground eels! 

Not-- Aw, damnit..! 

No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight? 

You're such a fatass, Cartman!

Wendy! You didn't!

Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.

Mr. Hankey, come here. 

Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss.

Yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores?  And what about all the- 

Yeah, I guess so.

Hey, fatass! Instead of laying in bed eating, why don't you come and help?!

Heheh, heh, no problem, heh. No problem!

What the hell did you do??

Yeah. I guess... I guess everything is.

I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again.

Yeah! Tim-my! Tim-my!

Well sorry, dude, we weren't here.

Who wants to tell him?

God! 

Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me!

You!

Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.

Mom, there might be something that you should look into about Ike staying after school all the time-

Dude, come down here!

Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond used to be? Where we used to kayak and fish?

I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid.

And we don't care.

Yeah, but you know? I think we all learned an important lesson about laughing at other people's misfortunes.

Butters!

So?

Huh?

Huh?

When is Mr. Hat coming back?

All right, where should we trick-or-treat first?

What the fuck is going on?!

Get out of here.

All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan like America.

It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.

But all the guys are going!

DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?!

...Totally what?

I think you're awesome, Funnybot. Uh, but you can't go around taking everyone else's jobs.

I'm not a dick, I'm like Gandhi!

Yeah, you're a great Meheecan, Butters, just not a great leader of Meheeco. 

Ready.

That's it!

What?

Yeah. This is really their fault.

Friends? 

Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!

That should just about do it.

What's "bad touch"?

No Grandma??

I know it's hard to think about, but you have to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel.

How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade.

We have in our possession something of great power.  It is... The Lord of the Rings.

Guys, have you seen Kenny?

Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast.

Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't.

Cartman, you do have pinkeye!

Stan, it's me.

What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?

Jesus, I can't do anything.  I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government.  Uh, hello? Jesus?

Where... is... the Internet?

ManBearPig? 

What? 

I... I know.

Aw it's horrible! 

We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible!

Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass.

Dude, he's not gonna swing! So just throw balls. That way he'll have to walk to first base. 

Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull.

Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop.

Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?

I thought of it two days ago!

Yeah, come on! 

And that's it? That's the end?

Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.

Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how.

What?? For God's sake, why??

If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong.

Why?

Cartman?

What are we gonna do?

Get ready guys. Whoever is in here is the kid that's hacking our e-mails and phone calls! You guys ready?!

-bring me back my little brother, God damnit!

I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!

Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long.

Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me?

Dude! That's today!

Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.

I'm not looking at that!

I thought I did. 

Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.

Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?

Can't we just play hide and seek at home?

Why do you have these?

Me?! It was your stupid-ass writing!

I am happy, Stan. I'm thrilled.

We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!

No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination.

No, ah, I'm an arcane fire mage.

Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!!

I'm dead to you?

Hey, fatass. How's prison?

We have to talk to Terrance.

My fault?

Dude, it's coming through the window! 

What do you mean?

You're keeping that money yourself?

Did you do it?

Geez, all that from a stupid video show.
