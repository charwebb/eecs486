She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay.
A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!
I am Tooth Decay. Your teeth shall be mine. With candy and treats I will take-
Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him.
It says right there "a parent has to be with you to sign up," and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha! 
How come the visitors aren't coming for him?
And Stan for being in love with Wendy.
Dude, you said you wouldn't say everything looked like shit!
We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!
Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for.
I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.
I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous.
I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?
Okay. But you've gotta promise to not complain.
Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.
Ike, you can't possibly want this. We have to tell Mom.
Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!
Oh cool. We get to watch a movie?
Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film! 
Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me.
The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!
I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal.
I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee.
Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall?
...Remember when life used to be simple and cool?
Yeah, all you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!
Yeah, I like him a lot more than Cartman.
Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.
Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pig your whole life?
...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, "We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny." And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane! 
Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?
Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?
Ike, please. I know your first love seems like the only love, but trust me, it's not. You have so much life ahead of you. 
Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat.
Hey, excuse me, but we need some help.
Or if you sold one to an "Eric Cartman"?
THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!
You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?
Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!
God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW!
Alright, this is gonna sting for a second. 
Okay, okay, you can have your powers back.
So where are students getting all this cough medicine??  This surveillance footage shows a group of troubled kids getting all the smack they want from a pharmacist!  Sexy Action School News reported the pharmacist to the South Park police, and he was immediately arrested! 
Oh no! It's that  super-sad Sarah McLachlan commercial! Look away!
I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud!  Tell my parents I'll call them. 
Hey dudes.  Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?
Hold it!  Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streible. We have something we need to tell you.
Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?
Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines.
Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!
Get him!  Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?
We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble.
Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes.
What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!
Ike, what's the matter?  Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on?  Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this?
Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.  Whoa! That was cool.
Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career!
He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass.
We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.
I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller! 
Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up.
Come on dude, we have to get to practice.
Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?
This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek.
Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!! 
Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company.
No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later. 
We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is goin' tuh try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch.
And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.
Okay so, what exactly are we doing now?
Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.
Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.
Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.
I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live with us. It'll be just like having a brother. 
Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?
Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.
So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody.
Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend.
This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers. 
I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away.
Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg!
Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson.
Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies.
So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.
Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous. 
Set an open course for the virgin sea...
No, we really want nothing more to do with these people.
Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!
It's okay. Everyone, it's okay. Perhaps one day, you will all understand. What I do, I do because I care about each and every one of you. 
"Wanted by U.S. Border Patrol"?! "Permission to shoot on sight"?!
It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this.
Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?
If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im.
Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?
Rebecca, in public school,  we select our... own mate.  In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy.
It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!
Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.
I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.
Nono Dad, please. I just gotÂ Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together.
We have to watch them! We can't miss it!
This is it, Stan. If you strike this kid out, we all get to go home.
Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more!
I can see clearly now, the rain is goneI can see all obstacles in my way-
I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.
No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?
Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay.
Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault!
Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!
Guys, I think we should bail out of this right now!
I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!
We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!
I'm never speaking to either of you ever again! 
Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these!
Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now.
Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!
The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. "Curse words" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.
We want to talk to who's in charge.
Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!
You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!
I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff.
All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend.
If it's on the school network we can track the IP address.  This way. In here.  Whoever it is using the computer in the music room.
Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.
Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.
Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!
I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman.
The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! 
No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?
Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!
Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith.
Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but...
He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over.
Fine,Â Â then we'll shut our cable off altogether!
Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it!  It's so simple!
How the hell do you have more friends than me?
Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew! You're a Jew! Shut your God-damned Jew mouth! Good job, Jew! Jew... Shut up, Jew! You're Jewish!! Dude, he's Jewish! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew?! "I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm." "Fuck off, Cartman!"
Dude, our town is going to be better without the-  What the?
But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried.
Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!
I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!
Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of Family Guy forever!
Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!
You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.
It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.
Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith!
...french fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-french fries... I wonder where our parents are.
You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do.
Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids.
Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. &lt;&gt;
Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.
You won't get more votes than us, asshole!
Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?
Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.
God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house!
No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.
Will you get out of my living room, please?!Â Â Hello?!
That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years!
Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool.
What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?! 
This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman.
Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.
You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-
Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-
Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him.
I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's being an asshole!
Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles! 
Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?
Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!
There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.
No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him. 
Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away.
You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, "shit"! I think it might have something to do with people dying!
Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one.  Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody? 
I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band.
Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's!
Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus?
Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!
Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything. 
I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to!
Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy.
I think I'll add some more... pigs.  Oh, maybe I should put in another field of corn there.  There we go. Nice.  Twenty nine? No, I have thirty friends.  Hey what the hell is-? Oh no! Oh shit! 
Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!
How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?
But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values.
Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons?
So I guess this means we get to keep our weapons.
You just want Family Guy off the air...
Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters.
I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all!
Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here.
I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it.
I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.
We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom.
We need to see the new Prime Minister.
Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.
So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?
That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?
Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?
Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about!
Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally.
Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams.
Damnit!  Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??
Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast.
Beause he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath!
Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?
It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.
Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!
All right, let's see.  Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!
God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!
Ask her if we get the watch right away.
Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them.
You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?!
So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!
Dad.  Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you.
I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.
Uhâ¦yeahâ¦we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.
Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!
You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!
Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!
That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.
God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!
Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.  Knock it off, asshole!
But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.
Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing.
Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!
Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!
Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?
If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.
I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.
Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.
But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.
Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.
...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!
That does it! I know what I have to do! 
Geez, all that from a stupid video show.
Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program?  How much to take a whale into space?  Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on.  Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?
Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! 
You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away!
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?
Can you act like you're giving him a lot?
Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door!
Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?
Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food?
I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.
Stan, don't you think this has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal?  Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche.
God damn it!  Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up. 
He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the visitors!
Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid.
Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.
The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.
Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.
To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.
You hope, and I'll hurry.
You pray, and I'll plan
We'll do what's necessary, 'cause
Even a miracle needs a hand!
Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late!
Stop being a pouty little bitch 'cause you lost, Cartman!
All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!  Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!
We have to speed this up!  Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?
No, ah I didn't lie to you. Ah I was um... uh I felt better and then the guys called and said that they felt better and uh-
All right, then we go with the plan. Just like "To Catch A Predator".  The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219. 
Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.
Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.
Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?
Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black. 
I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!
I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.
There. Do you really want that asshole to win?
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.
We need some more fur.  I think that's good.
And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, "Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous."
We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too... 
I have to show you something.  I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.
We're trying to raise money for our school chef.
I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner.
You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!
Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.
...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. 
I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?
Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!
Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again.
They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say "Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!"
Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!
Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die!
Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.
Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?
Thanks for seeing us, sir. My friend is really worried about his dad.
How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?
Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here.  So we made you this cake.  There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.
We need you to protect us... from a bully.
All right. Thanks for your help, dudes.  Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing.
What?? "A-ight"'s not cool, either? When did that happen?
I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!
Yeah. And I can still get my A!
That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls.
Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?
No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this.  Waaaaah! 
Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened.
Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame.
I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can. 
What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!
Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven. 
Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too!
Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days.
Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?
Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. 
You guys, we can't let him do this!
God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-
Oh yeah.  Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick! 
We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!
I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!
Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss.
