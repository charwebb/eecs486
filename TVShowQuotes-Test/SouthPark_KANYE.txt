Shut up!  Alright, now what do we know about fishsticks?  They're breaded, they're fried, they're frozen. Then under me we have rapper, genius. And gay fish are homosexual. They swim.  Is it because breaded has something to do with genius? Which swims?

Think you can make fun of me? I'm a genius! I'm the voice of a generation! What are you?!

Yo, that is messed up, yo! I am not gay, and I sure as hell ain't no fish! Alright?!

Once upon a time, there was a little hobbit who lived in the forest. And all the hobbit ever wanted was to be beautiful. And even though she was short and fat and hairy, this little hobbit dreamed that one day she could be pretty like Beyoncé.  And then one day, along came a magic power, called Photoshop. And just like that, poof, the little hobbit was beautiful. And even though she still couldn't sing like Beyoncé, or dance like Beyoncé, or act like Beyoncé, or be a decent human being like Beyoncé, the little hobbit was looked up to and loved, just like Beyoncé!  Soon she had money, and adoration, and a hip-hop fiancée who loved her very much-  I'm sorry, hold up. Hold up, I'm sorry.  Everything was good for the hobbit. But then this mean little girl, called the Jelly Monster, she was sooo jelly of the hobbit that she told everyone she was a liar, and the hobbit's fiancée realized she was just a hobbit. And you know what he said? He said "I don't CARE!" And then the jelly monster came and tried to take the magic power away from the little hobbit, so the hobbit prayed to God, and God said "Don't worry, little hobbit. I will go find this jelly monster girl, and I will read her a story and melt her icy heart." And the hobbit said "Thank you," and the hobbit and God lived happily ever after in the shower forever 'cause I love her so much!  I'm sorry, hold up. Hold up. Hold up. I'm sorry.
