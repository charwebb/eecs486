Alright hold up! Hold up! I'm sorry pope, but hold up! I just gotta say this! If my fiancée is a hobbit, then uh, Then what, bitch? Okay, yeah yeah  Okay, if she... was... ih if she is a hobbit, then, how come she don't turn blue when goblins are near?  Oh, you didn't think of that! Oh, I guess she's not a hobbit then! She must be a beautiful, sexy woman!
Tie up these motherfuckers!  Now I'm gonna ask you motherfuckers one more time: why did you start these rumors about me?!
Man, get the fuck out of here, you hobbit trivia bitch!  Who the fuck asked you?!  Nobody is talkin' any more shit about my woman! Alright?! She is gorgeous! If she was here, you could all see for yourselves how beautiful she is! But she can't be here because she has a movie comin' out on Friday, directed by Peter Jackson, called The Hobbit! Hold up.  Bitch, that movie you got comin' out is called The Hobbit? ... Yeah, but it- ... What? It's what? Ohhh yeah. Yup. Yeah, I got it. Yup. Yup. Lemme tell them. Love you too.  Kim is not even in that movie! That movie is just loosely based on her television show, Keepin' Up With The Kardashians, which is a show about short, loud, little people living in a fantasy world! Hold. Up! Bitch, if you're the hobbit, you need to let me know right now, 'cause I'm makin' a fool of myself out here!
