(running after him) Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!
This is so exciting. When are you going to sign the contract?
(to Jerry) Do the dog routine.
This one is kind of scratched.
Oh thanks again.
O-oh are you sure?
What?
I don't wanna worry him. We'll tell him next time we go up.
Elaine...
I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.
(to Jerry, happily) So we have you for five more days!
F. F, E, L , D.
Aaron surprised us, and Elaine came.
And this other ones the one?
What does that mean?
Don't sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom.
Uh we'll come back another time.
Why did he do that?
Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person.
I told you it was good. (hands Kramer the lotion)
You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came.
How could you do such a thing?
Doris.
He loves that pen.
If you were using it, we wouldn't use it.
(to Jerry) I told you to let us sleep in there.
Buh bye.
Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections.
You know, you cant be so particular. Nobodys perfect.
So dont go.
And so much personality! But, it doesn't matter what we think. Do you like her?
They're right in front of you! Oh, for heaven's sakes... (She puts the phone down on the couch and goes to help Morty.) Show you...
You didn't have to take it.
See you downstairs with the car.
What's the matter with you?
Jerry doesn't wash these very well.
What guy?
I'm afraid I don't.
(like Jerry) Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here. (goes to shut the door on him)
I want to know what you did to this guy that he's after you.
We'll pay for the car.
Well call you.
I'm not gonna ask her out.
It was... different.
They're exhausting it's like being in an Asylum.
Nobody pays for everyting.
She's not six-six.
You want my urine?
