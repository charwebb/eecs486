Who am I, Rich Little?
That's why we joined a program. We walk once around the block three times a week.
You're hurting my eardrum.
I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.
(to Jerry, happily) So we have you for five more days!
(looking at Jerry while being overly hugged by Aaron) We'll call you when we get home.
Yknow, Jerry, we dont have to do this.
Well it's too late now.
Wondering what?
Jerry, we just heard, what's going on?
Scuba diving? Who's going scuba diving?
What?
We already sold it.
(like Jerry) Hello, Newman. Jerry's not here. (goes to shut the door on him)
Well I'll ask him when he gets up.
When would we go?
Jerry.
What ever happened with NBC and the deal?
What's the matter with you?
How could you?
Wait, I just want to see something.
Ah, how 'bout a cup of coffee or something?
He has nothing to do.
What?
I can do that.
What?
(annoyed) We have plans.
Jerry? Leo told us he saw your bounced check. Are you having money problems?
With the instructor?
Alright, (sitting on the couch) we'll wait. (pointedly) But it's unheard of.
We have no plans.
Well, we could, but we wanted the bulkhead.
Will you challenge it?
Over my dead body.
You know, you should give Manya a call.
You were making out during Schindler's List?
I can see if there was a weight problem...
Hes kidding, Manya.
What happened?
Well you must have done something.
(turns to Jerry) We have plans.
(indicating to Jerry) She's very attractive.
Hello Aaron
I'm worried. What happens if we have to support Jerry?
We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters?
Whatever I wrote down.
You're hot?
If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you.
