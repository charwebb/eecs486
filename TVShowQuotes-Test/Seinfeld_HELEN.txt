Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac. He hasn't got that kind of money.
Ha, ha, ha Oh, What happened to you?
Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. How 'bout a feta cheese omelette?
You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready?
Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?

Oh stop worrying so much about how you look.
(sharply, to Jerry) Are you out of your mind?
We gotta catch the early-bird. It's only between four-thirty and six.
Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read.
Jerry? Leo told us he saw your bounced check. Are you having money problems?
Morty, thats ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!
