Oh! my god, Morty lets go, this is too nice.
Just a second, I have to go to the bathroom.
Yes. (to Jerry) Oh, your father bought a exercise device off the television. He does it every morning at four.
(admonishing) No, he never heard you. (prods Morty's back) I told you he didn't hear you.
That's why we joined a program. We walk once around the block three times a week.
You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came.
(to Aaron) It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see us off.
Well, we could, but we wanted the bulkhead.
We got it from Sullivan's. It's a good store.
Well, I think shes a very attractive girl.
And didn't the three hours go by just like that (snaps her fingers)
That watch was a gift. You shouldn't have to pay for it.
What am I gonna do in the bathroom?
So what's the matter with this Devola guy?
I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.
Sometimes your father forgets, so I have to steal them.
