Can we stop by a drug store first?
So, did you get to talk to her?
Well we should at least tell them what happened. They might be very late if they make it at all.
From.. (Trying to read one) from John Cheever.
(sighs) You know what George, uh. Why don't you go ahead. I think I'd like to be alone for a while.
I don't know. Anyway I thought we'd all go to a movie on Friday.
What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?
You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all. Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step forward in our relationship.
Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code.
Oh, I don't know. I couldn't hear anything. You, you talked the whole movie.
My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making a mistake.
Oh I know exactly where this is. You can just follow us.
We lost them. Do you KNOW THAT. WE LOST THEM!
