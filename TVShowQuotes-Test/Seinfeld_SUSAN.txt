I don't know. Anyway I thought we'd all go to a movie on Friday.
(tossing her purse on the dash) I told you to take the offer.
I just don't know what she sees in *Kramer*.
Well you know, if you need some more. I can get them for ya.
Excuse me. (Answer the door. It's her doorman, Raymond, carrying a burnt box) Hello, Raymond.
Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there.
Oh, I'm just moving in some more of my stuff.
Well from now on I'll keep you apprised of my cycles.
Did you know Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for that? Boy, she's beautiful, don't you think? I wish I looked like that.
(Now gestures to an old woman in a wheelchair) And this is my Aunt, Sara.
No, no. That's not the guy. That's a different guy.
Ok, thanks. Come on in for a second. (They move into the living room. Susan gestures to a man sitting on the couch reading the paper) This is my brother, Ricky. He's home from college for the weekend.
Give it to me. (She rips it open.) Come on. Come on!
