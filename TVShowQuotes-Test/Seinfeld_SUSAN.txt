What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?
I'm excited. Oh, you're going to love this cabin. My grandfather built it in 1947. It's it's incredible.
I don't know. Anyway I thought we'd all go to a movie on Friday.
This is Mona.
You're very sweet...
The what?
You okay?
I want you to tell me, George.
Well, we're a couple. It's understood.
(Pleading) No, Mr. Costanza! No, no!
Oh, no! That's too bad.
Yeah, we got along real well.
Well be-because you know that, because this is your first show it's a pretty standard deal.
Oh! no. George that's so ugly we don't want that.
You know, I really like Sheila a lot.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
Well, where does he live?
People don't change.
No. Susan.
Ehahh, forget it.
What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm fired!
Look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you my baby bluey?
GEORGE, you coming to bed? I'm taping Mad About You.
Oh, I?m so excited, now we get to see the opera together.
I thought you saw that before. How come you're watching that again?
You do? What?
Yeah, *sure*... I gotta go.
Can we stop by a drug store first?
Hmmm?
You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all. Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step forward in our relationship.
George, it's a doll.
(also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to be named Seven!
I thought you two guys were working today.
But you told me anyway?
I'll speak to you later.
Well, what about the flyers?
Turn it off. You're making me jealous. I'm gonna think you like her more than you like me.
