You think so?
(to Hallie) Mmm, mm, mm. Hallie (points to her plate) taste this fish. It's really delicious.
What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm fired!
Well, there's nothing I can do.
Alright, well... Good seeing you, George.
Uhh.. about the cabin..
Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you.
Are you sure?
Aw, what are you getting George?
O.K.
Because, it's part of our relationship, it's an indication of trust. We're not supposed to keep secrets from one another.
Oh, I used to love to sleep with my dolls when I was a little girl..
No. Out of the question. I don't want any women ushers at my wedding and while we're on the subject, Kramer is not an usher either.
Yeah, I know who he is. (laughs) You're not Ted Danson.
Oh, it was on the windshield of the car when we came out of that rest stop.
Oh, how could he be so vain?
Did you like it?
Give it back!
I don't know. Where'd you put it?
(Chuckles as she opens up one of the letters. She reads it) "Dear Henry, last night with you was bliss. I fear my.. orgasm (She now has everyone's attention) has left me a cripple. I don't how how I shall ever get back to work.. (Jerry and George make odd faces as Susan is still concentrating on the notes) I love you madly, John. (Pause) P.S. Loved the cabin." (George nods, and Jerry gives a "Oh, of course" reaction)
(disappointed)All right. You see what I do for you.
Thank you...
George?
Wait a minute, This is right on the way to the cabin.
Here give it to me.
Nah! He's too weird he'd fall or something. He'd ruin the whole ceremony.
Well, we're a couple. It's understood.
Cultivate it?
yeah! Thank you.
Aww.
I've never seen you smoke.
I want you to tell me, George.
Ha.Ha.Ha. ha...You don't have any money. I make more money than you do. ha. ha. ha. Yeah.. give me the papers I'll sign 'em.( she leaves) a pre-nup...
(standing) Uh, Elaine, I have to ask you a question.
Mmm.
What's a bubble boy?
Oh no-no, it's okay. *comment from transcriber yeah, she doesn't want to be paid, didn't she send the bill?*
Well from now on I'll keep you apprised of my cycles.
