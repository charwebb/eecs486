What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm fired!
Because, it's part of our relationship, it's an indication of trust. We're not supposed to keep secrets from one another.
Look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you my baby bluey?
Ha.Ha.Ha. ha...You don't have any money. I make more money than you do. ha. ha. ha. Yeah.. give me the papers I'll sign 'em.( she leaves) a pre-nup...
Ohh, because he said that he had to talk with you earlier about some problem that you were having.

Hello? (with hesitant surprise) Oh, that sounds great. I love that sort of stuff.
