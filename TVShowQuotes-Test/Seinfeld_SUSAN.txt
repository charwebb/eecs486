Well you could use a little flash.
And they got along?
I'm going to the ladies room.
Hey! Elaine! Jerry. Over here!
Yeah, we got along real well.
Ah.
I didn't even know she was dating anyone.
Yeah, I know who he is. (laughs) You're not Ted Danson.
You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's really thin.
A little baby girl?
No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it.
I'm out of birth control stuff.
Yeah, I know. We talked all about that.
(Chuckles as she opens up one of the letters. She reads it) "Dear Henry, last night with you was bliss. I fear my.. orgasm (She now has everyone's attention) has left me a cripple. I don't how how I shall ever get back to work.. (Jerry and George make odd faces as Susan is still concentrating on the notes) I love you madly, John. (Pause) P.S. Loved the cabin." (George nods, and Jerry gives a "Oh, of course" reaction)
What?

I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda.
What's the matter?

(Solemn) No. Nothing.
And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman.
Hey, I gotta get some cash, I'm gonna run down to the ATM.
Yeah.
O.K.
(Rushing in) What? What is it?
Ah, no. I don't think so.
Those were his exact words.

Ha.Ha.Ha. ha...You don't have any money. I make more money than you do. ha. ha. ha. Yeah.. give me the papers I'll sign 'em.( she leaves) a pre-nup...
Come on, George, just tear it open.
yeah! Thank you.
Hello? (with hesitant surprise) Oh, that sounds great. I love that sort of stuff.
Oh, I don't know.
Ohh, because he said that he had to talk with you earlier about some problem that you were having.
Art Vandelay?
I just don't know what she sees in *Kramer*.
I don't know. Anyway I thought we'd all go to a movie on Friday.
Ah, it was okay. What's going on?
